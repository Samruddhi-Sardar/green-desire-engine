# Models & Checkpoints
Large model files are excluded to keep the repo lightweight.

Options:
1) Use Hugging Face Hub models (e.g., FinBERT).
2) Download my fine-tuned checkpoints from GitHub Releases.
3) Re-train locally via scripts/notebooks.

Place downloaded weights under `models/` and update paths in:
- `src/sentiment_stance.py`
- `notebooks/main_code.ipynb`
