tesla,Tesla,36,"so. the problem with ai today is twofold ml is not ai as a massive oversimplification, machine learning is not intelligence. it is statistics, or answering what is the most probable common outcome to this input? . it is not symbolic but numerical. i curated the wiki entry on ml here for some more sources and an in depth look at the field of statistics ml. ml is biased the second biggest problem for ml is that the training is not dynamic, but instead it is the foundation through which the algorithm analyses data. again i ll oversimplify but training an ml algorithm is the process and it takes a lot of forms and shapes in which the model crafts a statistical formula, which it then applies to real data. this means that the results of ml algorithms are always dependent on that initial training phase. which is dependent on the initial set of data upon which i launched the training. you see where i am going you need all the possible permutations of a dataset in order to be even remotely accurate. in case of tesla, for an ml algorithm that recognises obstacles they would need a good generalisation of every possible obstacle in existence before reaching any semblance of accuracy. but hey, can t the ml algorithm learn from enviroment? no. because ml is dumb and rigid as a rock, it is not ai, it doesn t have semantic and episodic memory. the imprinting of the training is what keeps it together. you can replace ml algorithms one after the other, but the training is not stochastic, it has minimal weight fluctuations each time a new batch is launched, and it operates in a black box. the more complex the algo, the more divergent are the different versions. and every time it has to starts from zero. get the training dataset, launch the model, test it and release into production. over and over with the only improvement that can be made is the initial training data. which is, for things like tesla, many billions of individually curated images videos datastreams. good luck finding antagonistic data in there by this point, there are some people making serious bank just by processing segmented data through mechanical turk. the current consensus is that ml doesn t display the qualities that are associated with artificial intelligence for these reasons, and it cannot be used for decision making. while there are some frindge ml technologies that approach gofai like outcomes, anything outside of marketing claiming that it is ai is sexier that ml that needs to work anything automated on a battlefield uses cognitive architectures developed by dedicated research centres. tesla is stuck with a lot of very expensive data, a lot of a data scientists that have to justify their paychecks, but since 2013 there are no ai architects in there.",-0.31,negative

bentley,,37,"i would say the ford panther platform. that platform existed from 1979 to 2011 and was the basis of so many ford made sedans and wagons in that time period. the fact that it last more than 30 years is impressive imo. from the panther platform, we got the ford crown victoria, mercury grand marquis, lincoln town car, and the ford police interceptor, and all of those were very reliable and last well past the quarter million mile marker. some panther cars have made it to 400,000 miles.",0.8126,positive
porsche,Porsche,3,"raises hand neither do i. i m still bigly into cars, but now i kinda have become more realistic though i am only like 26 . but yeah, i used to really like all the super hypercars like all the koenigseggs, mclarens, laferraris and all that. right now though, hard pass, really don t care for them. too unattainable, too overkill. don t keep myself updated on them at all. and i don t know, the lykan hypersport really made me cringe, like the headlights with jewels, gold stitching on seats and all. feels too russian oligarch, they re the types who like to flaunt their wealth everywhere they go. now i remember being like hoo boy when the porsche 991 gt2 rs came out and it was auto only. like no, i don t care about trying to be 0.0000000001 seconds faster than jochen around the track, my idea of a good time would be autobahn on early morning hours around 4 9 am especially in bavaria baden w rttemberg, where there s less population density and longer unrestricted sections when there are less traffic. but now that i think of it, i would actually like a manual 992 gt2. now i mean, let the 700 750 hp gt2 rs be auto only, for serious track driving, breaking records and all that, while the normal gt2 with 550 600 hp and stick would be an enthusiast car. of course lately i ve also become kinda a r outrun and r vaporwaveaesthetics type of guy, so i d say my interests have pretty much shifted now. at this point, of porsches i like the old air cooled 911s from 70s through 90s g model, 930, 964 and 993 . while i don t like the 996, then 997 is okay, but i d rather have a late 80s carrera 3.2 or a 993. and strictly stick shift only. ferraris i like if they re also from the same period, two seater, mid engined, pop up headlights and gated shifters. so 308 yay magnum , 328, 348 and f355. also sonny crockett s favorite testarossa and the 512tr. but any modern ones like f8, 812 i know nothing about, don t keep myself updated on them. lambos though at this point i m gonna call a pass for now. not that i think they re bad cars i don t , but rather too exclusive for me, only like 2,000 countachs and 3,000 diablos were ever built, compared to like 10,000 testarossas testarossa, 512tr, f512m and only like 400 jalpas compared to about 20,000 308s 328s combined. speaking of magnum p.i., the 308 he drove in the 80s fit perfectly, good design and good performance for the time 200 230 hp, 0 60 6 7 sec . but the 488 spider in the reboot which i wasn t a fan of in the first place , like oh boy, 660 hp, flappy paddles, 0 60 in 3 seconds, sounds quite overkill even by today s standards. so i m more into classics oldtimers now. though of the newer ones, i d say i like vettes with pop ups c4 c5 and vipers not the newest gen though .",0.999,positive

tesla,,23,"pretty damn impressive, for sure. i m an old fart. my p3d was respectably quick, but i got to the point where i wasn t really using it that way very often. partly because passengers hated me for it, and partly because it made me nauseous after a couple times. the next time i am looking for a sporty ev, i don t think i lll bother looking at anything faster than around 4s to 60. hell, a solid 5s dual motor would be totally great. give me comfortable, supportive seats, and handling.",0.4998,positive
tesla,Model S,13,i was trying to be diplomatic about the range numbers. but yes expectation is 220 240 miles for the epa range of the various trims. the model s without performance already has 370 miles of range with the latest updates. an updated pack to say 120 kwhs would push that to 430 miles of range for the base and 400 or so for the performance in current dual motor form . other then the roadster there doesn t seem anyone that could touch that kind of range in the near term.,0.5499,positive
tesla,Tesla,46,"lol tesla stock has no correlation with their performance and has been that way since ages. sales up 25 ?, stock up 10 . sales down 25 and a tesla just crashed on autopilot, believe it or not, still up 10 . it s mostly an elon hype measurement system at this point. that s why they can t afford to get rid of him.",0.1531,positive
rollsroyce,,13,"mmm... this is an in general vent, right? because i don t think any driving enthusiasts give a shit about anything rolls makes, because rolls doesn t sell cars that are ....... yknow, fun and engaging to drive. they sell extreme levels of luxury to be driven around in , which means cars that are really disconnected from the road, so you can be whisked along in relative silence and without much appearance of motion. hell, they literally have courses for your driver to take to learn how to drive in a way that you feel less motion. i m not going to say that rr owners are not enthusiasts, just that they are not going to sit in the back seat and care about being genuine enthusiasts who want to drive them as nature intended at least in the moment.",0.4145,positive
