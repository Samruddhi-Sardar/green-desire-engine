I think a much simpler conclusion is that the shutdown of many service industries coupled with higher disposable incomes has led to more consumption of goods in their place.

bentley,,cars,cdedv6,etuovj2,2019-07-15T18:56:33,trevize1138,3,"You can't and from what I understand it's not a simple matter of adapters because DC fast charging capabilities on-board the car need to be compatible. I don't know of any non-Tesla EVs that have been designed to have charging systems compatible with Tesla Superchargers even though Tesla has said they'd allow it.  Teslas are designed to be compatible with CHAdeMO (probably going the way of BetaMax and HD DVD) and CCS fast chargers so going the other way is just a matter of adapters. As for why other OEMs haven't tried to make their cars Tesla compatible I don't know. It's certainly a current advantage as Teslas can use Superchargers *and* a host of other chargers.  Of course, each EV comes with its own charging cord and standard adapters for either 120 or 240 volt outlets. That's what I'm using 95% of the time to charge in my garage."

Tesla took the worst route imaginable on it, but the cars sold well, so other OEMs tried to buy into those design cues Tesla buyers tolerated, even if they weren't the draw of the car.  They want something that makes their product cheaper and easier to design, which screen do. You don't have to worry about sourcing parts for gauges and buttons that change between models when they're a configuration option in software that needs created one time.  Some customers are unhappy with these design choices (myself included) and are giving OEMs a fight over annoyances in the design. IMO, the OEMs aren't so much looking for a hood balance by their standards, but are more trying to push customers into accepting something they want to do."

I know the common arguments but I would like to see your insight.  On another note, with the new fa20 do you think the new WRX has lost some of its ""soul"" so to speak? I know this is a unpopular opinion but I think losing the ubiquitous Subie rumble is a step in the wrong direction. I think when car makers lose their identity so to speak, they lose their fan base. Volvo and Audi with their 5 cylinders had some of the most unique engines with awesome sounding exhaust notes but the new 2.0t's just don't do it. The New Supra merging with the BMW Z3 is not doing justice to the Supra name.   Anyways what I'm trying to say is that do you think as time progress, cars will become less and less quirky and unique?  "

If you ""deleted"" your profile in 2009 but resigned up for FB again right now, you would see all of your old friends still on your friend's list, updated phone numbers, etc. This is *despite* your account being completely new from your perspective. It's because FB never deleted it. They kept it on their servers for if/when you come back.  Furthermore, even if you never had FB, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc accounts (literally never signed up for any of them at all), FB still knows your name, phone number, email address, home address, etc etc. This is because their apps source these data points from phones, so if one of your friends has the FB app installed on their phone, FB can get all of your info from that."

It also uses DOT 4+ LV brake fluid from the factory, and can effectively use anything between 87 and 93 octane on the stock tune...pulling timing and limiting boost with 87, and using all 15psi of boost with 93. The Theta II-i (not the same engine as the Theta II) requires 12psi of oil pressure at all times, so you can (or should) only use the OEM Hyundai oil filter that supplies up 15psi of oil pressure without bypassing. The pops and burbles from the exhaust that it comes with are actually the result of a functional anti-lag system that keeps the turbo spooled up between gears.   Any little factoid I missed?"

The hard part is getting your foot in the door at an automaker, though -- or living in a place where one exists. That's one reason why I  recommend dealership groups; because they're all over and therefore easier to find (and I personally had more fun working at car dealers than for the automaker itself).   When I got hired at Porsche, I was relentless in making it clear i wanted a job and I just kept reaching out until I got hired. *BUT* it was easier for me because I started off as a three-day-a-week intern, which is not much risk to the company. Of course it'd be different if you are further along in your career."

The type of person who wants a fast sports car for the road but also wants comfort would probably go for a Turbo, but with GT3s comfort is definitely not the focus of the car. The GT3 is driver oriented enough that buyers don‘t value comfort as much, but also “road car enough“ in the sense that it is not a race car/super car (where the overall slightly slower manual isn’t an issue for buyers either)."

I’m thinking of buying it at the end of the lease. Should I run for the hills and get something else?  Have you or anyone else heard anything about Audi? Do they have the same issues? I could see myself in an Audi.  I know Lexuses are fantastically reliable but I just can’t get into their current lineup except the LC500. But at the LC500’s price point I feel there are way better cars to be had.  Except for the really expensive models, Mercs are boring to me (not as sporty as BMWs and Audis).

I'd like to think (and this is just a speculation) the idea is that there is fewer parts to fail in a touchscreen as opposed to multiple buttons for multiole functions and the mechanical thingies that control whatever you're controlling.  Of course if you break the physical button for seat warmer, you don't get warm seats until it's fixed. If the touchscreen is broken and the 3957 things it controls are inaccessible,  you pretty much should not drive the car at all."

You could literally buy a BRAND NEW car, that you know hasn't been abused by previous owners, and had a power train warranty that would guarantee you so many thousand miles without paying repair bills, for a 4-digit price.   Unfortunately the margins weren't high enough for Chevy, and the trend in general now is that WAY too many idiots are willing to take out 10-year loans on vehicles that cost 1.0+ x their salary, and the margins are way higher on those vehicles.

When I was in high school (there goes the old guy...), the supercars were the Porsche 911 Turbo, the Ferrari 308, and the Lambo Countach and everyone had a poster of one or the other one their wall.  But there so few of them that you could literally count them and know all about them, and the Ferrari cost maybe 3-4 time as much as a ""normal"" car (Good new cars were $20kish, 308s were around $68k iirc).  I liked reading about them and being a ""fan"" of them because they felt aspirational - you might one day get the job where you could buy that 911.  Now they all seem to cost $500k up into the millions and there's simply no way I or most other humans are ever going to be able to reach that high.  The result being that now they're actually zero interest to me, and the fact that there now seem to be 75 different models in this price range doesn't help."

I say this as both a car guy and someone who wants to retire comfortably. I would love a brand new 4Runner right now and can in fact afford one. As far as brand new cars go, it's also a very resilient choice in terms of holding resale value.

Most NA Cars can compensate a little bit thanks to variable valve timing and air intakes that can be opened up, but making a one off camset just for pikes peak is pretty expensive. That's why most just go the turbo route as they can simply up the boost.

If you want to keep going you can say it shares a platform with the Audi A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and their S and RS versions. Also the e-tron and Q5. There’s this weird misconception that vehicles on the same platform are identical under the skin. Also the vehicle was available only with the W12 at launch, the V8 is a newer option. This is the type of thing an auto journalist will pad a column with not something that is in any way relevant to owners."

The teams will guide the project using the best known practices, and the chief will review the work, and determine if the direction of one team is aligned. More importantly, he will need to make very tough decisions about balancing various aspects of engine development. For example, a higher compression ratio is better for thermal efficiency, but, it leads to more engine pre-ignition and knocking. Where to draw the line is a decision arrived at by all people. But the chief has the final say.  That said, I agree with you, in that is a very high pressure job, and he/she will be reporting to VPs and the CEO.

You mean the time the dealers revolted and forced them back to the dealer model?  Dealers could do that because many local laws force dealers on OEMs, and if you want to sell in specific states you need dealers.  So if you try direct sales in one state and all the states you are forced to use dealers revolt you are kind of screwed.  It wasn't because direct sales don't work.  It was because the dealers banded together and used their legal power to force a nationwide dealer network.  It was not a financial decision.  > Even a single auto maker is much, much larger than the largest dealer group. If auto makers wanted to actually put up a fight against dealers, they would steamroll the dealers.  You really need to learn the laws.  In many states dealers are forced onto OEMs.  Those dealers band together and revolt against OEMs if they try to sell direct in states that allow direct sales.  That is why in some states you can't get a Tesla and have to buy in another state (Tesla doesn't have direct sale stores in states that force dealers on them because they know those 3rd party dealers will force nationwide dealer networks like they do Ford, GM, etc.), and in other states their direct sales stores are severely limited.

My experiences with them are limited to one or two times, but we will get there in a minute.  However, I have plenty experiencie with Porsche. I've been on the sit of a 911 even before I was capable to drive, and I learned from it thanks to my grandpa.   One of my firsts ""Toy cars"" was a 911 GT3 (which was replaced by more modern GT2 the last year) and from all the things that I ever drived, Porsche is the one to always beat on both comfort on performance, keeping a solid record on daily driving.  When the need to get an Hybrid/Electric came to my doorstep a few months ago, I chose a car that could serve as an every-day ride but keeping that heritage and sportier feel. The '22 Taycan Turbo S was the obvious choice for me.   It's been six months since I got that car, and I must say it's not perfect, but it feels... Very complete. Competent. The electric engines react quite fast and the power delivery is top-notch. The acceleration it's truly marvelous; Considering it's weight, length, and overall wheelbase, it's quite agile, as long you keep the throttle steady or pushing. The extra power of the Turbo and Turbo S helps tremendously; But what I do love more about, it's the interior. When you sat on it, put your hands on the steering wheel, that car won't allow you to forget it's a Porsche. The quality of the leather it's so incredibly that you could sleep there without feeling sore (once I was too drunk to drive back home and I had to do that. Don't judge me!) The infoentertainment system it's nothing glamorous, but it's easy to use and it cover the basics without issues.  Like I said, it feels like a Porsche. Only bigger, heavier, and longer. But it's powerful and comfortable, nonetheless.   Now with Tesla... Around a month ago, I was genuinely curious if, and only if, I made the right call with my Taycan (I know how weird it sounds, but I'm a weird girl. Sue me.) So I started wondering about other electric alternatives and I remembered Tesla. Following my curiosity, I asked a co-worker of mine if he could let me borrow his car, a Tesla Model S, for an interview a few miles away of the office (that was a lie) and he agreed. As soon I got on the highway... Well... My Taycan always remembered me he was a Porsche. And that thing wasn't a Porsche, by all means.   If the Taycan feels heavy, the Model S feels like school bus; It's not exactly the most intuitive car in terms of response for maneuvering at high-speeds; They do react very similarly for acceleration, and I did noticed that the energy consumption it's a bit better, but I don't mind that since I don't drive long distances very often. The weight-shift balance feels wrong. The steering and direction it's way more rigid, the suspension have some awkward configuration that make it tilt a lot, and with a ride of that weight, then you will feel it, a lot. Oh, but how did I missed that fine German leather interior!  I do love a good, comfy/sportier interior... I say that 'cause while the interior of the Model S is not bad, I must say I'm not a fan of the aesthetic it have. Sure, that huge screen is a marvel, but I don't relly on tech that much while driving. For me it feels excessive.   If you ask me why Porsche sells more than Tesla, I do believe it's not only for the pedigree or the reputation.  I won't lie, both cars are very good on what they do, but...  While the Tesla feels more focused on the all-day driving with the better energy economy and better infoentertainment; the Taycan offers a more sportier, and by extension, a more comfortable driving experience. Also, the Porsche feels... How to say it?... More trustworthy. But that's just me."

Meanwhile, a gas car can catch on fire because a fuel or oil line decides to leak at the wrong time and splash a flammable liquid all over a hot engine part.

Stuff like deep brain stimulation treatments for parkinsons were FDA approved at least 20 years ago. Neural prosthetics have been tested in humans for years.  >But they're the first to really put it all together in a good way.  They're not doing that here either. They've developed an alternative to the Utah microelectrode array, and given it wifi capabilities. That sort of neuronal spiking data has been available in vivo for years. That's not the issue. The issue is what to do with that data, and how to interpret it, and how to develop treatment strategies once we know what the problem is. Neuralink does absolutely nothing on that front. They've developed a different sort of tool, and are claiming that it will solve massively complicated problems.  His claims to cure depression and anxiety are laughable, because those are extremely complex mental pathologies that aren't fully understood - Neuralink doesn't help with that.

In fact, I'd say that you'd probably be critical of new cars' interiors no matter what as long as they deviate from what you reminisce about, and that's perfectly normal.  >I just can't see people who are 7-8 years old now remembering the 2010 ATS or CTS like how I remembered the Buick Regals from the 1990s.  Just like people with fond memories of the cars from the sixties they grew up in may not like the direction that interior design took in the eighties, there will definitely be some who share your views only with the dates shifted a few decades. It has always been that way with things that people care about.  From my point of view, old cars are clearly inferior to their modern-day counterparts in practically all areas; the only potential reasons I can think of for why some might prefer them are looks and nostalgia, and those are valid reasons that I respect. I think the vast majority of us will adopt a similar stance on most subjects we care about eventually throughout our lives."

First, overheating issues and 'limp mode' on a manual 2017 is news to me. They implemented fixes starting with the 2017 model and the only reports of overheating on 2017+ Zs after those fixes, were reported by those with Auto transmissions due to the secondary 'auxiliary' radiator already being in use by the transmission, and thus couldn't be utilized for additional cooling. Even those are rare and only reported by people tracking theirs.     Second, I'm really curious about how you went through so much rubber. I beat the shit out of my '16Z and managed just shy of 15k miles out of my factory Cup 2s. I also haven't had any wheel or MR shock issues, and I drive year-round on NJ roads.

So it comes down to- either you have a gap to fill in your prototyping process or production line, or a specific 3D printing process enables you to create geometry that was impossible or incredibly difficult before. In aerospace we are able to consolidate hundreds of parts into 1 single part (like an annular combustion chamber being 1 part now). In automotive, we have the article above, plus 3D printing is used a lot in tooling (low volume part). I think BMW was printing cylinder heads in order to increase performance.

It is statistics, or answering ""what is the most probable (common) outcome to this input?"". It is not symbolic but numerical.  I curated the Wiki entry on ML [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Artificial_intelligence) for some more sources and an in-depth look at the field of statistics/ML.  **ML is Biased** The second biggest problem for ML is that the training is not dynamic, but instead it is the foundation through which the algorithm analyses data. Again I'll oversimplify but ""training"" an ML algorithm is the process (and it takes a *lot* of forms and shapes) in which the model crafts a statistical formula, which it then applies to real data. This means that the results of ML algorithms are always dependent on that initial training phase. Which is dependent on the initial set of data upon which I launched the training. You see where I am going: *you need all the possible permutations of a dataset in order to be even remotely accurate.* In case of Tesla, for an ML algorithm that recognises obstacles they would need a good generalisation of *every possible obstacle in existence* before reaching any semblance of accuracy.  *But hey, can't the ML algorithm learn from enviroment?* No. because ML is dumb and rigid as a rock, it is not AI, it doesn't have semantic and episodic memory. The imprinting of the training is what keeps it together. You can replace ML algorithms one after the other, but the training is not stochastic, it has minimal weight fluctuations each time a new batch is launched, and it operates in a black box. The more complex the algo, the more divergent are the different versions. And every time it has to starts from zero. Get the training dataset, launch the model, test it and release into production. Over and over with the only improvement that can be made is the initial training data. Which is, for things like Tesla, many billions of individually curated images/videos/datastreams. Good luck finding antagonistic data in there by this point, there are some people making serious **bank** just by processing segmented data through Mechanical Turk.  The current consensus is that ML doesn't display the qualities that are associated with Artificial Intelligence for these reasons, and it cannot be used for decision-making. While there are some frindge ML technologies that approach GOFAI-like outcomes, anything outside of marketing (claiming that it is ""AI"" is sexier that ML) that needs to work (anything automated on a battlefield) uses cognitive architectures developed by dedicated research centres.  Tesla is stuck with a lot of very expensive data, a lot of a data scientists that have to justify their paychecks, but since 2013 there are no AI architects in there."

I live in Germany and never owned a BMW myself, but will consider one as a next car.  It is know that they are expensive to drive because of the high prices for parts and the very expensive labor cost in a shop. Also it’s normal to change fluids every year if you drive short distances.  Fun fact: A mechanic repaired the window of my vw golf Cabrio and told me the price for the spare part is 4x Compared to a similar part of BMW.   BMWs are seen here on the same quality level as cars from Audi or Mercedes.  Of course Porsche is above them (they are also more expensive).  All of them are know for the high prices while owing them (service costs are ridiculous).  And I know that the cars are engineered to last around 200,000 miles. Of course not without repairs and maintenance.   No one here will argue that Japanese cars are bad in quality.

Turboprops and turbofans take this to another level, since the jet does very little of the work and only exists to power/boost a much larger fan or propeller through the same axle it uses to turbocharge itself. In other words, most of the air is just blasted back and only a small portion goes into the ""engine."" It's also worth noting that they are super efficient for that reason, especially compared to other ""jet"" engines that don't do the ""turbo"" thing (like a rocket engine or an old WW2 design or the liquid jet engine that makes a jet-ski go)"

The majority of regular everyday cars are designed and configured to understeer. Thus, when you are driving in slippery conditions (i dunno, rain, snow, ice) or just have too much speed before a corner, you will slide outside of the corner. Going for a late apex leaves you less road in front if you in case if you misjudge your grip and let understeer happen.   In order to stop understeering, you need to reduce the load on your tyres aka request less grip at the same time. Unless you are trying to accelerate mid-corner in FWD car, what you need to do is either partially straighten the steering wheel (turn less sharply) or completely straighten the wheel and reduce speed by braking.   Going for late apex leaves you very little room to correct mistakes related to misjudging grip and speed compared to regular ""geometric racing line"", let alone an early apex. If you just use a regular line, you have more time and more room to catch that understeer or reduce speed before sliding out of the corner or into a car in the other lane. Also, your steering angle stays the same from beginning to the end of the corner which ensures (except for complex cases) that if you had enough grip entering the corner, you will also have enough to exit it.  Also, with late apex your initial turn-in has to be way sharper compared to the other two options (and, more importantly, other cars which one could use as an example to determine corner entry speed i.e. ""everyone is going *this* fast and able to make this maneuver thus i can too""), which again is more error-prone for a regular everyday driver."

According to a google search, the final drive ratio of the Tesla Model S is 9.73. It has a top speed of 155mph. I'm not sure of the limitations of RPM for electric drivetrains, so I assume for the case of the Roadster the gear ratio will be lowered to be able to reach the 250+mph without blowing up the motors.  Assuming a similar 'top speed/gear ratio' ratio, 250 divided by 155, let's just round to 1.6. So let's now divide the current gear ratio to get a new gear ratio for the Roadster: 9.73/1.6=6.08.  6.08 final drive. Now let's try to find the drivetrain torque using the listed wheel torque and the final drive: 10,000/6.08=1,645Nm.  That looks like a much more accurate number to compare to in my eyes. These are just my brain's thought processes with limited knowledge, so if my logic is off feel free to correct.

Prochargers are belt driven ""turbochargers"". They have the compressor half of a turbocharger, but instead of a turbine to generate power from the exhaust gas, it's instead a belt connected to the crankshaft.

They still take time to get exhaust pressure, get up to their target speed, build boost, send that boost to the intake.

If you mean why not put a physical ball joint at the intersection point, the advantage is mostly packaging although there will be dynamic differences as well because the virtual ball joint moves as you steer. Sometimes it may not be possible to put a physical joint at the desired location at all. Then, if the alternative is to have the lower joint further inboard, there are a lot of reasons why you may or may not want to do that, it gets complicated to answer because it depends on the rest of the design."

The European general public doesn’t care any more about manuals than the US does. They buy them as they are usually cheaper (automatics are cost options) and most know how to use one anyway.   They use to be even more popular because a manual would make the most out of the weaker small displacement engines (both in power and economy) they typically have, but modern transmission advances have made those points irrelevant.   There’s almost no manual uptake in high end cars over there because if you’re paying for a luxury/high end sports car the cost savings of a manual are generally irrelevant when compared to the purchase price.   (Note I’m talking in general, not saying there aren’t people who enjoy driving a manual over there for the sake of it).  The US is entirely keeping the manual alive in high end cars as it’s one of the few places people are fine with spending a lot of money on a car with a stick."

Solving the riddle of how each specific type of cancer is positively treated has proven to be one of the more daunting riddles humanity has yet to solve.

Do NOT drive it, even if your dad says it's fine. It really isn't and Murphy's Law is there for a reason. If you tell your dad this he'll find you very responsible. Unless your dad is worth billions. Then he is pretty much self insured at that point.  Second: Head on a swivel. Look everywhere. Pay attention to every car. Be prepared for people to take pictures while driving. And when they take pictures they can drift where you are at. Depending on where they are accelerate away or slow down.  Third: Keep your distance and check your rear view when you brake. Sometimes you got to give people behind you more room to react and you can do that by using the distance you have in front of you.  Finally: Keep all the nannies on and don't hit it unless you are in a straight line on dry pavement. It's a Ferrari, so the handling is better than most other cars on the road.

lucid,,cars,14uirtn,jr9l7r0,2023-07-09T11:45:11,tujuggernaut,14,"> Engineers are almost never the problem when designing cars.  Only BMW (and maybe some Audi).  Things like burying a valvetronic motor so deep in the top end it will require 4+ hours to change when it fails or using plastic valve covers that inevitably come off warped and are thus 'disposable' (but expensive).  Or plastic charge pipes that fail under stock boost at the plastic welds.  Or a trunk release mechanism so complicated it take hours to adjust.  Non-weather-proof electronic keys with zero manual methods to start the vehicle.  Batteries that require DME programming when changing otherwise you will literally cause $2k in electronics damage.  Same for a jump start done incorrectly (ie not the BMW way).  No dipstick, uses a sensor instead.  The N54 and N55 are great examples of engineering exercises that out-of-the-factory look like great engines.  After they get real usage, it starts to become clear the many weaknesses they have, largely to do complexity (the N55 was a step in simplification, but not that much more reliable).    I had a good friend who had several Porsches and he said the parts cost and waits from Germany were about twice as bad as BMW, but that the parts themselves were really good and held up to serious usage like lots of track days.  Couldn't say the same about my BMW.  It would lose alignment after one pothole.  Also the e-diff is pathetic.  It's a sad day when you can't even get an LSD as an option, and the damn driveshaft is welded so figure 5k to put one in."

That's why when you drive on I-5 in Oregon, you see RV dealers that go for miles. You buy your RV in Oregon with no tax, plate it there for next to nothing and then use it as you wish. Since it's an RV, why does it matter where it's plated? In fact, you'd be stupid to plate it anywhere else. They'll even store it for you until you need it.  These rich people are taking a risk as most states require a vehicle you own to be registered in the state of your residence after 2 weeks to 1 month. You can of course legally get around that by taking it out of state and bringing it back, but it wouldn't have low miles, would it?  There was a point where I had a lease/plates in Texas, a Washington licence and California insurance.

The Cybertruck has to certify the whole truck.       Electric motors have been around a long time.  Mosfets have been around 50 years.      Sure, the batteries for this new crop of EV were lab stuff 30 years ago, but Ford simply bought the batteries, like Tesla did up until a couple years ago.

I have come to realize that *most* exotics and supercars are not actually that special in a sense or performance or build quality. Most of them do not have extravagant features or unattainable performance or perfect build quality. 75% of what makes them so special is their exclusivity. There are several vehicles around the $75K-$120K price range that have just as much performance or as good (if not better) build quality.

They just want to help you pick a car that works for you, and get their normal commission. If the car you want isn’t the one they have they give you their card and ask you to look them up if you decide you do want something you drove there.  If you end up at a dealership and there are no people in sales older than 30, fucking run man. It means they’re hiring anyone with a pulse willing to do anything to make a sale."

The brand is carefully managed so that demand always vastly exceeds supply.   Imagine a band playing a venue that seats 10 thousand people, but there is demand for 20 thousand tickets. Do tickets sold go up if demand went to 30 thousand? Of course not. And it wouldn't change even if demand went up to 40 thousand, or even a million.   Many astute luxury brands play this game. They understand that the only way to maintain desirability is to make the product hard to get. How do you make it hard to get when your customer base is super rich and can easily afford multiple of them? Choke down supply hard, so that even super rich people need to wait on the waiting list.

But back when they *did* expect trucks with lower power engines to tow a lot, they designed ample transmissions to pair with them. A great example of this would be the Ram 2500 from the 90's that had as little as 175hp and was still rated to tow 12,000 lbs all day.   Also, I would argue that as a towing vehicle, you probably shouldn't be doing 80mph, even if traffic is moving faster. That said, I think it's reasonable to creep up power to make towing easier, but the 2x increase in power seen in the last two decades is by no means ""necessary"""
tesla,Tesla,cars,mtfd00,guzv40b,2021-04-18T18:45:17,gogojack,18,"> You can't design enough safety controls to circumvent stupidity.  Were the drivers stupid?  It appears so.  Yet, where did they get the idea that the car would drive itself?  Yes, a Tesla can pull out of a tight parking space and come slowly to where you are.  A neat party trick.  Yes, a Tesla can ""drive itself"" to a certain extent, but it's a party trick, not a fully autonomous vehicle.  Around where I live Waymo has been operating for a few years, and Cruise is ramping up their testing in the area.  Do they let civilians get behind the wheel of one of their vehicles?  Hell no, because they understand that the technology is not at that point.  What they've been doing, for lack of a better term, is *teaching their cars how to drive.*  Sending them out with a trainer (to train the car, not the people) and perhaps someone else on board helping to input data, troubleshoot, etc.  Waymo is at the point now where they're acting as taxis, but there's always someone in the driver's seat because they know it's not ready yet.  I think Cruise may be operating some autonomous taxis in San Francisco, but I don't know if the operate without a ""backup"" driver.  Tesla is perhaps irresponsible for calling their feature ""autopilot.""  The name implies the car can drive itself.  It can't.  Eventually autonomous vehicles will be at the point where they can be deployed on a large scale.  That will be great for a number of reasons, but we're not there yet, and Tesla sure as hell isn't."
rollsroyce,,cars,c2wc90,ern55b8,2019-06-20T15:34:04,Michelanvalo,335,"I drove my friend's Model 3 over a weekend and I had similar thoughts about the car. One thing I disagree with you on is the seat, I'm 6'0"" tall and had no issue with getting the seat to adjust to my liking. I'm not sure what is up with the one you rented but I had no problems with the headrest and my shoulders and all that.  I also found the same problems you found with AutoPilot. It makes some *strange* decisions at times when traveling at speed in moderate traffic. It tends to work best with either a lot of slow traffic or no traffic, moderate traffic gives it the most problems. My friend says that during his morning commute he barely pays attention anymore, the car does all the work for him, since it's mostly bumper to bumper up the highway to his office.  As far as connecting with the car goes, it definitely feels like you're driving an Apple Car. The way everything is designed reminds me of my company iPhone. It's sleek and nice looking but when you need to do something nitty gritty it's a pain in the ass and often locked away from you without hacking the software. The Tesla UI feels very similar to that. I still found myself being able to enjoy driving the car, as it is RWD with Instant Torque and I didn't find the steering to be as vague as you did. I thought the steering was precise enough to enjoy the car when you were on a windy road.  Also you can turn off the traction control in the same menu as the Chill mode setting. It's not call traction control, it has a different name.  Lastly, do you remember that South Park episode about all the smug Prius drivers? Yeah, those people exist, they just moved onto Tesla."
lucid,,cars,pywmot,hez4oaf,2021-10-01T13:55:40,-ZeroF56,14,"So my experience with the Mach E isn’t a *ton*, but I walked away thinking the interior is overall higher quality (in both materials and build) than the Tesla, the tech is good, and it’s a better driving experience than I expected out of a crossover. Handling is more composed than I anticipated, and even in not the GT trim, it’s still pretty quick.   My biggest takeaway though is the Mach E feels like it’s not attempting to reinvent the wheel. It feels like a relatively “normal” car that Ford’s made electric. It’s not trying to be something insane. Its just a nice car overall, with solid quality, a nice interior, good cargo space, and above average performance. And it just so happens to be an EV.  Compared to the Tesla that can be a *big* plus depending on your preferences, because Tesla does try to reinvent the wheel with things. There’s a bit to get used to going to the all-screen setup, having no traditional gauges, etc. - it didn’t take me long to get used to it, but you  have to be comfortable with doing things differently. Tesla is also unafraid to change things on a whim.   Ford’s choice to be somewhat conservative with the Mach E is a solid hand to play imo. They’re offering a great drivetrain with a familiar experience which is a home run. Even if the Mach E isn’t “industry leading” in terms of numbers and features, imo it undoubtedly offers the better all around experience at just being a car.   I’ve driven the Model Y a few miles, but owned a Model 3 - given they share a *lot*, my takeaways from owning a Tesla are effectively:  1) As a general rule of thumb, tech is better than the Mach E. Easier to use, more responsive, more features, and frequent updates. The app is also very easy and I never had issues with it. Some weird stuff is missing (like no 360 camera) but overall Tesla has the edge in tech.   2) Quality isn’t anything to write home about. Overall build is sub-par, and interior materials are *ok* to be generous. I think the Mach E is much nicer on both fronts. Instead, Tesla has you pay “luxury car” money, and it goes to the drivetrain/standard tech/performance, and not quality.   3) Performance for the 3 and Y is very good. Better than the (non-GT) Mach E. The steering feels more connected, acceleration is far more than necessary. Autopilot does a pretty darn good job as long as you use it as intended.   4) Tesla as a company is... questionable. Depending on what service center you’re near, service may be a nightmare, getting to their customer support is near impossible, and since Tesla doesn’t make upgrades by model year, you never really know when changed cars are coming out. For example, for a little while 3/Y had auto dimming mirrors, then for a few months they didn’t, then they came back. The only way people found out about this was when they got their car.   5) Don’t underestimate charging networks - a handful of trips in my Model 3 would’ve been painful, if not impossible, without the Supercharger network. The car is well integrated with it, so it can automatically route you for charging, knows how many chargers are open and if any are offline. - Third party chargers in my experience were hit and miss. They all take different apps and payment methods, a handful just didn’t work at all, and at least where I live, there’s not a ton of Level 3 charging that isn’t Superchargers. Meanwhile with the Tesla, it was just plug in and you’re fine. Nothing to mess around with, well integrated and reliable.  Basically, I think Tesla has the win if you want the most cutting edge tech and best EV experience, but are willing to put up with worse quality/customer service, and doing things the Tesla way. They’ll offer the best “pure” tech and EV experience, but they’re going to the point where sometimes that new update you got is one step forward, two steps back until the next one in a couple weeks. - So you get cutting edge, but you also *live with* cutting edge.   Ford won’t do that. So Ford has the win if you want a solid car that’s also has the performance of a solid (if not class-leading) EV, and you’re willing to put up with a bit less range, less charging infrastructure, and (a tiny bit) less tech. In exchange though, you’re getting that better quality, a wider dealer network/service, and a car that doesn’t try and be different for the sake of being different. Ford is taking their industry experience and applying it to an EV, and it positively shows. Tesla may be making the “future” but Ford is making the happy medium."

porsche,Porsche,cars,rshvy0,hqpcg2u,2021-12-31T17:29:43,hutacars,78,"Great writeup! As a fellow TM3P owner (a Minus, which it sounds like you also had if it shipped with MXM4s) who has also felt a love/hate relationship with the car, I'd like to address a few things, even though I'm sure this will be buried.  > Upon my departure of Tesland, I can't recall hearing of anyone replacing packs due to natural degradation. All the replacement stories I came across were pack failures in one form or another.  I'm a little confused by this. Your car was 15k miles into its 120k mile battery warranty. You don't mention any degradation you personally experienced, yet you cite it as a key reason for having sold the car. Why? Why not use up the battery warranty, and see how it fares in the meantime? WFIW, my car with 40k miles has degraded 10% already, most of it in the first 30k of ownership, with the last 10k being fairly flat. From what I read and see on Teslafi, this is the common experience. Makes me damn glad I went for the larger pack, but given I still have 80k of warranty left, it doesn't make me worried about the pack itself.  > So right off the batt (ha), you're 20% down if you're concerned for battery health.  You touched upon something I feel is not talked about nearly enough. Sometimes people on this forum look at rated range and go ""310 miles? That's nowhere near enough!"" Well, uh.... reality is actually way worse than that.  * You're not getting rated range on a road trip, at least with a Tesla. You're just not. Running at my preferred speed of 77 MPH, with AC low or off, on decent level ground, the mileage rating feels more like a kilometerage rating. I think the best I've reasonably done is around 220 miles, charging well into the 90% range and discharging well below 10%.  * But generally when you charge on a road trip, you're not charging to 90%+ because that would take way too long. Instead, you're charging from 5-70%, meaning only using 65% of the battery, or in my case 201 miles of rated range which is in reality around 154 miles. But that all probably doesn't even matter because:  * Range is charger-constrained, not battery-constrained. I recently drove from central TX to southern CA, which has a very defined Supercharger route-- essentially, you must stop at every Supercharger on the way no matter what size battery you have. Except this means chargers are spaced for the smallest 220-mile battery, and are therefore about 100-120 miles apart. So given you want to minimize charging time and don't want to charge above 70% or so, you're stopping every hour and a half no matter what. (And I presume if you have the smallest battery, you're forced to charge to 90%+ each time... oof.)  > since EVs are so efficient, every ""stressor"" they experience has a disproportionate impact on their range vs. a similar ICE vehicle.  Exactly. And that really adds up to a feeling of an overall fragile ecosystem-- everything only works because each component is perfectly efficient. But what if that's not the case? This point was driven home to me when I was driving south on I95 in Florida in gray weather. I was looking at the Supercharger map, and thinking ""I should be able to make it to Vero Beach no problem if I charge up enough; it's less than 200 miles away! And worst case, there's 4 other chargers on this route I could fall back to if needed."" So I charged above 90% and set off. Then it started raining. And raining. Pouring, even. I watched my rated range drop. And drop. ""Okay, I can't make Vero Beach, Palm Bay it is!"" Err, nope. ""Uh, okay, Titusville will do!"" Nope. Ultimately I pulled into the Daytona Beach charger with 20 miles of rated range left, having traveled just 84 miles. It really hammered home that efficiency is everything in an EV; take that away, and you realize just how little energy is truly contained in 2.2 gallons of gasoline. (Or more accurately, just how stupidly energy intensive moving 2 tons of metal with you at high speeds truly is.)  > At the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla.   I don't agree. If you can charge at home, and don't take too many road trips, virtually any EV (with the exception of those mid-100-mile range compliance EVs) is perfectly viable. And now that Tesla has seen fit to utterly destroy the infotainment system in a recent software update-- even /r/teslamotors is [up in arms](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rnz8tr/the_light_show_is_all_well_and_good_but_does/)-- I'm personally starting to consider those other EVs more than ever. The only downside is as an enthusiast, I've quite come to enjoy my mid-3s 0-60, and the only other EV that can do that in the ~60k range is the Mach E, which I'm kinda meh on overall. Here's hoping the EV6 GT actually comes out, and at a reasonable pricepoint-- or better yet, the Ioniq 5 introduces a GT variant, as that car is just stunning. Public charging is still an adventure with non-Tesla models, I will admit-- but if you either don't do that, or are willing to be an adventurer (I'm starting to fall in the latter category), it's perfectly doable. After all, consider the Porsche Taycan held the EV cannonball record for the majority of this year.  > When you go off the beaten path, that's when things get a little dicey. Every time we went somewhere a little ""unique,"" I'd have to carefully think about what type of range I could expect given the weather conditions and if it was realistic to make a round-trip without buggin'.  Yep. As I'll phrase it, ""I can go anywhere in this car... I just can't always get back."" There are large swaths of west TX I simply cannot feasibly travel. And check out the Supercharger route from Albuquerque NM to Wichita KS sometime.  I have also changed how I road trip-- if given the time, I used to use any road but highways. It's a much more scenic and interesting way to travel. Not so anymore, for obvious reasons. I expect this will improve over time as public fast chargers are added though.  > I genuinely feel like two years of driving this car has made me a dumber and less engaged driver.  I actually yelled ""YES!"" out loud when I read this part, heh. I don't know what it is. It's not like I've started getting into accidents or anything, but the Tesla absolutely seems to encourage dissociating the driver from the driving task in a way I've never felt with any of my other cars. Is it the coddling of technology and automation? Perhaps this is how it feels to drive a Camry? I'm really not sure.  > For most people, unfortunately, that's probably exactly what they want... but not me. I want to be involved. For most of my life, given the cars I've owned, the journey's always at least been some part of the reward.  After having sold my Mazdaspeed3 at the start of 2020, I hadn't driven stick again until a few months ago at the Houston Auto Show, where they miraculously had a manual STI available to drive at Subaru's ride-and-drive event. Even just driving that around the block at relatively tame speeds, I was quite excited and most definitely had the thought ""damn... I miss this."" (At the same time, I was still glad it wasn't me who had to pay to fuel and maintain it though....)  > And with the Tesla, I can't say that I ever really ""looked forward"" to driving it.  I have, but in a different way. I've always felt a sense of guilt about cars, as despite them being my #1 favorite hobby by far, it's an objectively awful one given the societal negative externalities. Driving an EV for me removes a lot of that guilt, which in turn allows me to simply enjoy driving more. I realize not everyone has that mental roadblock to begin with, but for me it really helped.  It also has allowed me to enjoy road trips in ways I never have before, though again, that's a very different form of ""looking foward to driving.""  > But I think all of their issues stem from dog-shit, stubborn management, rushing and not thinking things through carefully, an engineering-first approach, and Elon - a guy I can respect, but could use a serious ass-kicking once or twice.  Could not agree more.  > I remember coming across one topic where a guy with a Model X was wondering how he was going to take his family on a ski trip past a supercharger desert in the Northeast. They bought a bunch of 12V heated blankets to avoid running the heat. This is a $100K+ SUV we're talking about.  While I have not done anything quite so drastic, I fully admit I have modified my lifestyle in some small ways to accommodate the car, which some people would decry with ""if I have to modify my lifestyle in *any small way* this is completely unusable!! I will not stand for any inconvenience!!!"" But the fact is, you had to initially build your lifestyle in part around your chosen transportation method of choice anyways-- e.g. you would never have chosen to live in a car-dependent suburb with a garage if you hadn't also chosen to implode your finances with hundreds of dollars per month going towards a personal vehicle-- so having to make changes is really not a huge deal IMO. YMMV, but for me at least, the upsides of road tripping with an Autopilot-equipped EV outweigh the negatives.  [Continued...]"
tesla,Model S,cars,d5fu32,f0lqfte,2019-09-17T13:27:27,zombienudist,14,I don't think the battery was really the problem but more the motors overheating.   With a 3 motor setup you can spread the work out over more hardware.   Also the new updated raven model S/X uses the same type of motor in the front as the Model 3 uses.      It is a permanent magnet motor verses the old induction motor.   Those motors run cooler and there is plenty of evidence they can handle high speed runs fine.    There are videos of the performance Model 3 on the autobahn running up to max speed multiple times with seemingly little to no power reduction.     Also the prototype model S seems to have upgrading cooling shown by the bigger cutout for airflow in the front.    All this seems to point they might have the overheating issues of the old Model S at least under control if not solved.

That comment isn't meant to be nearly as snarky as it sounds, but nothing of what Tesla has done so far implies it's sustainable, regardless how impressive it really is. There's a lot of milestones they need to hit, like how they are going to service an exponentially growing population, how they handle a major recall that isn't software related, how they keep the product fresh in the market, etc.   I like to keep a pragmatic position on Tesla. I'm greatly impressed with many they have done, but that can't hide the absurd mountain of debt that continues to build and the loose cannon they have leading the charge."
