rollsroyce,,6,"i ve been seriously considering a model 3, and on monday i had an extended overnight test drive of a long range 3. seats are very subjective. my parents have a leaf and i can t stand the front seats back seats almost always sucks , my parents have no idea what i m on about. my mil is asian sized and last time she changed cars we test drove everything within her budget spec sheet combo and either specs price was impossible didn t want a diesel, in france which usually drove the price up 10k since she also wanted 4wd awd and a manual transmission not being able to talk her out of that is another story , and the rest she wasn t comfortable in the seat. ended up with a subaru xv. but i digress. the seats.. i was talking about seats... in my current a6 i have recaro sport seats and i love them. the seats in the 3 obviously isn t as good, but they re not bad by any means and i have no issues with the headrest. however i do miss the adjustable length of the seat as the seat offers very little support in that direction. i m not a big fan of the glass roof either, but mostly because i m worried it will break from stone chips every winter. expect for the inconvenience i suspect it will bring up the price on insurance over time. my problem is that even though the model 3 is not the car i am looking for, it s the only one that has all the things that i m looking for. 20 more range than the competition, more performance, awd, an autopilot system that will get better during my ownership and now a tow bar, albeit with a limited capacity. although i could afford an i pace or an entry level e tron i don t want to pay more for a car that feels like it isn t all that it could be. the i pace definitely had the best feel of the two. the e tron didn t seem to like its heft. the eqc will be more of the same, although the cheapest of the three. sure, the model 3 is more of an appliance than mechanical being to fall in love with. that s the case with all ev s i ve driven. i love my a6, i love the sound my money makes when i press the accelerator. i love the quietness of the cabin and the comfort. how smooth and fast it accelerates, well at least until i drove the 3. i also hate it. how much money it has cost me to keep it going. how everything that breaks is made unnecessarily complex and how much audi dares to charge for some of these things. if i order a part and it s less than 50 i m happily surprised. aftermarket parts with supposed oem quality has been anything but, and i feel like every time i ve tried to save a wee bit of money on something i end up rebuying the same part from audi and doing the work all over again. or how it s the second series of a6 in a row where the engineers have done stupid shit that causes the doors to rust apart from the inside. there s more rust on my 14 year old a6 now than it was on my 21 year old 100 when i retired it. so yeah, the model 3 is a step down in so many ways, but i m going to pull the trigger anyway. because even though i value the emotional connection to an ice, and the quietness and comfort, i ve come to realize that i value the comfort of starting electric preheating from an app, having a full charge every morning, the instant throttle response, and a theoretically much more hassle free ownership experience even more. i can always spend some of the difference to an eqc on soundproofing. it s not that the model 3 is the best car ever, far from it. it s just for the foreseeable future the seemingly best compromise. at least for me. my next ice will be something old and worthy of keeping alive. not a computer aided money sucker where the design flaws feels like they were made deliberately.",0.9984,positive,negative,0.6265222,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

bentley,,3,using those led and halogen inspection lights i use the following signs stage 1 remove 95 99 of scratches and swirls. 100 is impractical and wastes time and client s money. stage 2 remove any marks left behind by the stage 1 cut. stage 1 is so heavy that it removes defects but leaves behind little marks which can detract from the finish. stage 3 remove any haze and enhance gloss. i look to reduce the glow around the hotspot of the light and really bring out the metallic fleck.,-0.34,negative,negative,0.86896247,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
