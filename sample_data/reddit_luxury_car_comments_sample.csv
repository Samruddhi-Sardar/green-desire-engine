tesla,Model S,cars,13wj5dv,jmed6cz,2023-05-31T22:06:46,JSTFLK,6,"This again???          TLDR: 500HP+ vs. 180HP and a bunch of really other sad facts that absolutely doom hydrogen cars.   200lbs more weight and 2.7x the power for an energy source that is cheap and widely available vs. ""literally impossible to road trip and super expensive in the 5 counties that actually sell it"".          I'd actually kind of like to see a mirai in person just to know if the experience is as bad as the numbers are, but it'd have to be trailered across several states if I wasn't willing to fly to California, since it literally is unable to travel within 1,000 miles of the chicago area where I am and hydrogen stations AREN'T.          Model Y:      * $50k     * top speed 150mph    * 3.6 second 0-6mph    * AWD     * 26ft^3 cargo    * Drivetrain warranty 8 years or 100k miles  * 4439lb   Mirai:             * $50k  * Top speed 106mph      * 9.1 second 0-60mph      * RWD     * 10ft^3 cargo    * Drivetrain warranty is good for 5yrs/60k miles    * 4,350lb     * a rental voucher in case you want to drive across state lines on occasion. So that's something I guess.          Most EV drivers charge at home for $7 to $15 for 400 miles of range. A mirai is $80 to fill up [source](https://getjerry.com/questions/how-much-does-it-cost-to-fill-up-a-toyota-mirai) and is limited to just about 1.4 states in the US because hydrogen trucks can only wander so far from specialty chemical plants."

I want nothing to do with it. Its overpriced quirky garbage.   Also who the hell is even buying a new EV at this point. Used EV's are so cheap even a year two after being sold. You can pick up a well equipped 2022 Porche Taycan with Sub 10k miles for under 70k. Literally half the price of what the sticker cost would be a new version of the same vehicle."

Especially given that just 2 years ago you could get a premium trim that was well equipped for under $30k.  That said, while I think this is overly negative I don't disagree anywhere near as much.  I'm not sure what they've improved with this car to make it nearly $3k more expensive.

Try two wheels and a 4 second or better 0-60 with no steel cage or seat belts.  I digress.   There are only slight permutations in average available elsewhere in the segment. RAV4? Meh.

tesla,Model S,cars,15fr5me,jufr1ok,2023-08-02T03:33:48,DocPhilMcGraw,10,"Tesla is facing a founders dilemma problem.  Essentially when we look at every startup, there is a point in time when the person who led the company to a high point passes the baton (either by choice or by force of a vote of shareholders) to a new leader.  And there is good reason for it to happen as generally the person who started the company ends up running into a bunch of headwinds, lack of creativity, lack of new knowledge or ideas, etc.    However, in Tesla’s case that hasn’t happened because Musk seems hell bent on keeping control of the company with him as CEO.  Even in his other ventures like Twitter (errr X) that supposedly has a CEO, that person seems to be just CEO in name only.  He’s still calling all of the shots.  And we see now that is a HUGE detriment to Tesla as a brand.  In my opinion, the best time for him to have exited stage right would have been in 2019, after the launch of the Model Y. I think that the last great thing that Tesla produced was the 3/Y combo.  They were quite literally on a huge roll and I look back as that being the pinnacle in terms of his business acumen.   From that point forward, again in my opinion, it’s been bad decision after bad decision: Vision Only Full-Self Driving, Cybertruck design (and we know now there was  push back from a lot of people under him), the Roadster that still hasn’t come, the botched Semi roll out, focus on stupid robots, the last minute push for the NACS that could’ve happened years ago before there was legislation pushing the CCS, and generally Musk’s own political/personal opinions that have tarnished the brand.  Tesla would do so much more if they didn’t have a teenage edgelord calling the shots."

Track times and massive powerslides make for good magazine and video content, but most people don't drive their personal cars like that and a lot of people don't live near the kinds of roads that are rewarding in a pure sports car anyway. I just don't see any problem with driving around in a car that's 10% slower than it could be, if it's comfortable and makes good noises and feels special, oh, and can still outrun most other cars on the road. That last 10% of performance costs a lot, both in money and in compromises.  I drive a base-model V8 Mustang and see some of the same stigma against it. The Performance Pack model gets most of the attention. But on the road, the extra stiffness and aggression seems like a drawback, to me. The base V8 still has sports car suspension geometry and handles way better than its fashionable to admit. It just doesn't rupture your spleen and dent your oversized wheels when you hit a pothole."

I have no idea why so many people continue to gauge car performance based on this test.  For one, there is no standard for how people report these metrics. Some auto journalists report this with a 5ft rollout, some report from a dead stop, some report with a prepped track.  Also, different drivetrains need different launch parameters to achieve their optimum 0-60 time. The VA STi can record a sub 6 second 0-60 time, but you need to rev the sh\*t out of it and drop the clutch to build boost. No one is dumping the clutch like this regularly.  But the main issue is that the reported 0-60 times are not actually indicative of what the real world acceleration feels like. 5-60 without dumping the clutch (or launch control) would be a way more accurate look at how these cars FEEL. This, or peak acceleration G force would be a better way to look at this IMO. 0-80 is just as terrible as 0-60."

tesla,Model S,cars,14pweqh,jqkn4vw,2023-07-04T00:12:11,None,1,Software updates!  After a quick buzz through how has no one mentioned future proofing and keeping up with technology. After I went w an EV (granted a buttony Bolt EUV) - the screens are life changing in terms of companies that do software for a living (yes Tesla - but even more important apple car play and android auto). Apple CarPlay even 5 years ago was better than 98% of cars tech .. because they can do over the air software updates. Want a newer car or one that has ___ capability? Let’s patch you over a new OS that can tie that in!  Can’t do that with old cars.   I understand and respect older cars and their proponents but I fear you are missing a larger burgeoning crowd of people who’ve lived on screens their whole lives (granted I’m probably one of the older crowd who has converted) but that’s just me.   To OPs point I do wish there were more EVs with top notch interiors with all the bells and whistles. Not too terribly many are that inviting and I wish they had more interior options.

You are referring to Gebhardt's Sport Auto lap times, which may allow consistent time comparison of the Sport Auto laps, but Gebhardt is also about 5 to 10 seconds slower than manufacturers with their factory drivers."
tesla,Model S,cars,1eju2de,lghbbvg,2024-08-04T17:30:01,sevenfiftynorth,4,"I'm one of the 11% who went from a Tesla back to gas.  I leased a Tesla Model Y dual motor that I got at the beginning of summer in 2021 at a time when several people at work were making similar choices.  I live in an apartment without on-site charging.  I'm within 1.5 miles from a Tesla supercharger location and 1 mile from a Tesla Service Center, so I thought I could make it work.  It was fine during the summer and fall of that year.  As winter came around, I found myself charging more and more often, like every 2 to 3 days.  (I had Sentry Mode engaged all the time, and didn't fully appreciate the impact on the battery.)  I kept a book in the car for reading while sitting at the supercharger.  And I was spending nearly as much money charging as I would on gas.  The final straw was a 750 mile drive back from visiting my folks in the Midwest on the Sunday before Christmas where the temperature was well below freezing and the car recommended charging 7 times on the way back.  In January of 2022, Teslas were in demand to the point that I could end my lease early without paying a penalty.  I just needed to find something to replace it with.  At the time, 85% of new cars were selling for above MSRP.  My local Honda dealer had like 1 new car in stock.  But Stellantis (Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, RAM) dealerships were the outlier, with every dealership in my area having more than 100 new cars in stock, many priced at MSRP.  I bought the cheapest Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo within 50 miles.  It was a left-over 2021 model of the outgoing WK2 body style, but brand new nonetheless.  The MSRP was $39,630.  I got it at MSRP with 0% interest for 72 months, for a payment of $599/month.  Cheaper than the monthly lease payment on my Tesla Model Y.  My Jeep Grand Cherokee has a 24.6-gallon fuel tank.  Under normal circumstances, I fill the tank every other weekend.  On road trips, I only have to refuel every 500 miles.  My overall transportation costs (payment, fuel and insurance) are less with a traditional mid-sized gas-powered SUV than they were with the Tesla.  Long road trips to the rural Midwest don't require any strategy for battery management when I get there.  Personally, I'm better off in every way.  Obviously my experience is the opposite of someone with on-site charging.  Especially if you use air travel for your out-of-state trips rather than driving.  I hope to go back to electric at some point in the future.  But right now, with inflation and high interest rates, I plan to keep that Jeep Grand Cherokee for as long as possible."

tesla,Model S,cars,16pd80a,k1qshtm,2023-09-22T17:55:01,_galaga_,8,Probably an oddball question but did you ask them if a smaller sports car-sized vehicle was on their long-term roadmap?  I find it interesting the Tesla Roadster came out so early in modern EV history but nobody's gone back to that formula until the 718 EV and Lucid has all the Lego pieces in-house to make a car like that happen.  Or perhaps every company outside of Porsche is waiting for second gen battery tech to approach that segment?

Similar to you, I had a friend let me drive his model 3 and the car treated our two-way stop as a four-way stop, and tried bolting out in front of oncoming traffic.  Thankfully, being super cautious because it wasn't my car, I was ready to slam on the brake.   Well I do still think FSD beats Honda Sensing and Toyota TSS in capability, I feel a lot more confident in the more reserved/cautious systems from conventional automakers."

tesla,Model S,cars,1j0i9b8,mfft3g3,2025-03-01T14:56:30,shawn0fthedead,3,"That was the reason I put in the comment about gas. I don't understand why anyone would want an EV other than the environment (which I'm not educated enough to know whether the batteries are worse than gas, I don't know) and maybe the performance and instant torque of electric motors.    They take forever to charge. Some people say that charging them is cheaper than buying gas, (I've seen examples where it isn't, but let's say they're just charging it at home with regular electricity).    The insurance is still more expensive and road trips are a hassle.   So my point was, why try and save gas money with an EV, when you can get a car that performs as well or better than an EV, and still save money even though you're paying for gas.    And the thing with the Daytona charger, they're putting a combustion engine in it later anyways, and it's STILL going to cost as much as a used Hellcat. The pricing makes no sense. "
