porsche,,71,"It’s utterly devastating. He’s had a great life, but he still had so much more to live. You can tell how excited he was to try and win the ARA title next year at the end of his recent documentary. Then you have the build videos with his daughter. His wife also recently got into rallying. From my understanding, they weren’t forced into it. They both genuinely wanted to do it and get to spend more time with their dad. While I was at STPR this year, I unfortunately did not get a chance to meet Ken as I ran out of time before the stages began. It’s unfortunate because now I’ll never get that chance. The guy is a huge inspiration. Most guys grow up wishing they could be a racecar driver but our financial circumstances usually take us on another career path. Ken didn’t let that stop him. He made his money elsewhere and then used that to live out his childhood dreams at an age when most people give up on them or retire comfortably when you have his wealth. I often feel he was underrated by the rallying community because of his viral popularity. He genuinely improved every year as a driver. He got to help start two major clothing and entertainment brands in the 21st century, own a lot of his dream cars, race in many historic races when most would kill to be part of just one of them, and he has a good family that I feel immensely sorry for. I don’t know her personally, but Lia seems like a good kid who stays out of trouble and knows the value of work. RIP Ken."
tesla,,7,"That '67 GT500 traps probably 10-15 mph faster in the 1/4 mile than a 2019 Civic Sport. It's not ""about as fast as"", it's considerably faster. Even if they have comparable 0-60 times it's because one is boiling the tires off while the other has little or no traction issues. Have them both go 60 mph then mash the throttle, it won't take long to see which one is faster.  My point is if all it takes is the swapping of a wear item such as an old bias ply tire to a modern run of the mill summer radial tire for the straight line standing start difference to disappear that doesn't make the car slow.  Now handling, that GT500 will likely get beat by that Civic in pretty much any race where it can't stretch its legs, like technical autocross. I would never argue against that but those old cars still don't handle as poorly as many on here believe."
lucid,,58,"I always think that kei/mini trucks are overly glorified by American car enthusiasts. I understand why y'all like them, they are the antithesis of big American pickup trucks, compact, utilitarian, and actually used for work; and of course, because they are forbidden fruits, never sold in America. I understand why you want them, maybe for a farm truck, driving around the property, or if you live in the city as a daily commuter car.   But trust me, as someone who actually drives Daihatsu Hijet and Suzuki Carry a lot for work, they are crap. People or businesses that own these pick-up trucks are ""forced"" to own them because they can only afford them or because it's not feasible financially to get better trucks. I think you already know that they are slow, barely keeping up with the traffic, and struggling when going uphill, especially with stuffs on the bed. They are uncomfortable, the seats are uncomfortable, and you can't adjust them. They are built for short people, you can't adjust the position of the pedals. The suspensions are uncomfortably hard. It barely has noise insulation, you can't hear the music or talk to your passenger when you drive. Driving them on the motorway is scary, they are short and tall with thin tyres, bad combination. It feels like a wind can flip your car, or if you make a turn or lane change, it will flip. Getting a Hilux is a huge upgrade for me.   I like small pickup trucks too. I think the Hilux is a gas-guzzler, too big, and too ""luxurious"". Man, I wish they made a smaller, body-on-frame pickup truck, maybe Ford Maverick-sized, but with a regular cab and body-on-frame."
porsche,,9,You don't have to guess. OP's last sentence explicitly says as much.
tesla,,12,Thought Conquest was a Chrysler thing (ba dum tss)
porsche,,5,"The guy was clearly talking about a plug in hybrid given the range comment, and PHEVs do tend to be pretty underpowered when in full EV mode"
tesla,,6,Only PHEVs. Hybrids (HEVs) aren't included.
ferrari,Roma,39,Seems like I’m alone thinking the front is an upgrade. The car lost some elegance in the back compared to the Roma though.   I see why they kept it mostly the same as the silhouette on the car is gorgeous.
porsche,,3,"Honestly, my 16 yr old son drives my old Lexus SUV & has been in 2 accidents in the school parking lot this year. Neither one was his fault, so the other insurance has paid for both. One was his friend being a smartass, swerved towards my son’s car & lost control of his own vehicle, took out the back door while it was open. That was the 2nd day of school. Thankfully nobody was hurt. We got the car back a month later. The other was a girl driving a truck & she didn’t look behind her before backing out & backed right into the driver side while he was exiting the parking lot. This was 2 weeks after he got the car back. It’s once again in the shop & he’s in a rental again. Both of my kids know I only carry liability on their cars because who the hell can afford full coverage on 3 cars? And they are both really protective of their vehicles. It didn’t make financial sense to sell either one of the old cars to get other used cars because there’s no way I could get anything close in comparison to what I have put into those cars. I went through a really rough patch at one point & almost had both of them repossessed because I was flat broke. Ended up literally hiding them both in my garage. So my kids know the struggle I went through just to be able to keep them & what a relief it was when I finally paid them both off. I think it’s because of the financial struggles that they are both so respectful of what they’ve been given. So yeah, the mustang stays. I was never handed a car, had to buy my first car on my own. But I don’t want my kids to start out their lives struggling like I did."
tesla,,21,They would be adding miles not resetting to zero if that’s the goal
tesla,Model S,4,"You get the exact same stigma attached to the Nissan GT-R. Because I can drive it 1,000 miles with luggage and without destroying my body I have been able to take it to some of Europe's best tracks. If it was a brutal track day monster it would have stayed at home, only ever driven at the local track and In summer I would have taken a plane to an all inclusive resort and sat by the beach instead."
tesla,Model S,9,You don't need to flair the g35 we already know
ferrari,,883,"find a different dealer, I'd also call that guys sales manager. Personally. btw, as a 33 year old who looks 22, I can tell you I've had better luck trying to test drive sportier cars by calling ahead. A couple years ago I was denied a test drive in a Cayman when the 981s came out, he said they didnt have any for drive (which I knew was bogus), called the same dealer as soon as I left, said I was interested in test driving Caymans, came back after about an hour and drove one. The sales guy was probably pretty peeved seeing me with another sales guy the same day, but it was his loss. "
lucid,,6,As an EV driver of 8 years I would never want a hydrogen powered car.   People tend to complain about charging times of EVs.  But I save far more time being able to fuel at home then I lose charging when I am driving long distance.   So for me an EV is much more practical then a car I can't fuel at home.    Plus there have been many takedowns of this.  Hydrogen doesn't avoid the chip problem as they will still need chips to build them.  And fuel cell cars also have batteries although smaller then a BEV.     Plus at the current time hydrogen is very expensive.   And then finally the efficiency of creating hydrogen is pretty terrible.   So you are much better off to charge a battery pack directly with the electricity.  In the end I don't think hydrogen will be a fuel used for small vehciles.    It might see more use in larger ones though.
tesla,Model S,74,Remember when windows held a funeral for the iPhone?  Lol
ferrari,,37,"Gearing plays a part too. I had a 3.7 V6 Mustang, 300hp. On stock 3.15 gears it was slow af. Swapped out to 3.55s and it was much better. But tbh, it really needed 3.73 or 4.10. Ford put the 3.15 in it for fuel economy.   A lot of modern cars are geared way too long for fuel economy reasons. The IS500 should have much shorter gears. But Lexus geared it long for fuel economy and it kind of neuters the V8 a bit."
tesla,,161,">develop brain chips  The less is said about Neuralink, the better.  Everything they've actually shown is pretty standard neuroscience stuff fluffed up by marketing. They have no revolutionary technology. Musk built up their september showcase to be this incredible thing, by saying ""we're gonna see neurons fire live"" (That was first done in the 70s, so its about as old as he is), and the pig demonstration was just playing sounds in response to sensory stimulation of the snout, which was done about 20 years ago, give or take.  Proper universities are way ahead of anything Neuralink has demonstrated, and they have the added benefit of being held to higher standards, regarding what they claim and demonstrate.   Spiking data from in vivo neurons is old news; that's been possible for years. The hard part is processing that data in a useful way, and solving problems with it, something that Neuralink doesn't appear to do.  The only unique thing about Neuralink is that they have a garillionare funding them, and presumably they won't have to deal with funding issues like a university research group will. The downside of having a garillionare funding you, is said garillionare will then go on to say stupid irresponsible shit like ""it's a fitbit for your brain"", which no it fucking isn't, and to suggest that indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology at best."
porsche,,6,"Not really - the company they were using for their prototype prismatic cells went bankrupt, which added delays - and they still haven’t been able to hit internal targets for range/weight with different cells from CATL which caused the second big delay.   While demand is in the gutter now because of their decimation in the Chinese market, probably not a lot of weight behind getting it out the door."
tesla,Model S,26,Don't stop there. Charge it up again and find those last three seconds!
bentley,,8,"You say that so confidently, but what do you think a plaid is doing when you engage cheetah mode? Or when you engage launch control in any street car?   Why are the goal posts being moved now? I said you can hit 60 in under two seconds, and now you’re telling me there can’t be traction control and it needs to be on a tire that lasts 20000 miles like a ps4s? When every high performance exotic in the last twenty years ships with pirellis/eagles/cups that last 2k miles?   Bro I don’t know what to tell you. I’m using rwd as the argument that it can be done, and I’ve given multiple examples.   Now add awd. Add electric motor torque response. Add well-designed traction control. Add air suspension that can preload for launch.   Why are we pretending like I didn’t just show you multiple cars that accelerate way over 1g?   Fine. Take an old DSM, Gut the interior, make 600 hp, and add four Cup 2s. You’re going to hit 60 before two seconds. That’s an 8-9 second car, and a 10 second car on the worst road you’ve ever seen. I don’t get what the argument is here."
rollsroyce,,6,"I’ve had a M3P for 5 months now, have no issues and had no issues with body work or anything else at this point. 7k miles on the car.   I agree with a lot of the statements both positive and negative, but where I live in the Midwest a lot of the charging issues don’t exist for me here. I have a charger at home now, but before I did I never saw a SC more than half full.   I actually find the 2022 M3P a bit soft and spongy compared to the competitors as far as ride and suspension. The turning is very quick and tight though - maybe the difference between a sedan and a crossover."
tesla,,28,"> All brands should do this and cut out dealerships…  Not all car makers should be forced to sell through the dealership model, agreed.  But what I wouldn't want to happen is having all car makers forced to sell without the potential for middle-man involved.  BMW/Audi/Porsche/insert-favorite-car-maker-here should be legally capable of opening a flagship ""dealership"" that also includes a killer track that people can test drive on.  There shouldn't be any reason, from any state, that would prevent the maker from building the space, and paying for it.  At the same time, those same makers should also avoid wanting to get into the costs of land, building, maintenance, etc.  Remember: dealerships aren't dealing with just selling cars, they are paying local taxes, wages, maintenance, etc.  Some car makers simply may not want to get involved with that, and that's fine."
ferrari,,135,"I have a friend who has an impressive lack of knowledge about cars. Its going to sound like I'm making all this up because its almost cartoonish, but I'm not.  * He genuinely thought that cars had a certain amount of V's. Aka a V8 has 8 V's, a v6 has 6 V's * He has ridden in my loud, supercharged, white corvette plenty of times. I once had a rental 3 series in white which he rode in the back of. I asked him what he thinks of the 3 series, and that is when he realized it wasnt my Corvette * He thinks my 1995 Suzuki Sidekick is a jeep. He thinks I'm messing with him when I tell him it isnt a jeep. I finally convinced him by making him google it * My wife traded a 150k mile beat-to-death, gray dodge caliber for a black 2017 GTI. He couldnt tell the difference, and he thought the VW logo was the Mazda logo. * He thought my atom was ""One of the slowest"" because he only knows it from Forza. Apparently its the starter car, so ""logic"" led him to believing its hard to drive, and its the starter car, so everything after that is an upgrade.  I think hes about average for people who arent interested in cars, honestly."
lucid,,5,"As someone else already said, the wealthy are the best first adopters.  Perception is very important when marketing a new product. When car manufacturers first tried to offers small, economy EVs in the 1970s in response to the Oil Crisis, the public saw them being actively purchased by broke granola hippies and ""stick-it-to-the-man"" counterculture folks, therefore the association was negative.  Now, car manufacturers develop and market EVs as luxury vehicles, so the public perception has changed accordingly to see EVs as something wealthy and successful people buy and associate them as something cool, futuristic, and aspirational."
porsche,,173,"While not as severe as your instance, I lived in a house for 8 years where there were regular vehicle accidents, for similar reasons to yours and then some! Being near the end of a straight away, there were two fatal motorcycle wrecks as the result of trying to take the curve at over a hundred. I knew the person who died in both instances - not well, but still. Even if you are wearing a helmet, a tree does not care at that speed.  In the other direction, people will lose control and come reeeeal close to taking out my mailbox. One time, a lady passed out at the wheel, went off the road, taking out my mailbox, hitting the ditch as if were a ramp, travelling through my neighbors yard and coming to a stop in a bush. Ended up climbing through the window of her car myself and eventually pulled her out of the car so we could start chest compressions. That's a fun story to tell!  Edit: My favorite one is actually documented. Sitting at home one night in October and hear a loud bang and crash. Walk outside to what can only be described as a warzone.

lucid,,34,"They’re probably marginally more reliable than the rest of the field, but not like they were 30 years ago.   Reliability is just a crutch Toyota fans lean on to explain why they’re paying out the ass for cars that haven’t been updated in 15 years and why they won’t buy anything from any other manufacturer no matter how much better a value it is.   No, bro, you don’t need to pay $60k for a 4Runner with an appearance package because you’re worried about being stranded 1000 miles from civilization in a Wrangler."
rollsroyce,,3,"Thanks for the heads-up on checking the manual to find extra USB ports. I figured that if they were there they'd be easy to find and access, since everything else that I want sure seems to be, but I'll take a look at that this afternoon."
rollsroyce,,34,"Some people just give so little shits about how strangers perceive them that they're willing to downplay their image in exchange for some fun  Same people who would wear rag-tag clothing to a high-end car dealership so they get to talk to the new/humble salesman and play a joke on the vain salesmen that brush them off. *They* know they can afford the car, but they don't care if others know they can afford the car. "
tesla,,3,"Whole idea between Western and Asian is very different. It isn't just about their car industries, it's about almost everything, honestly."
tesla,,26,"Mostly because the extra power to throw around comes as a result of having more battery, and the motors themselves are relatively cheap to manufacture so may as well tie them into the trim levels so that added power can be made use of. It'd be like putting a block behind the accelerator pedal - reducing power for little to no reason.  The slowest version of the 3 with the 75kWh pack is the now-discontinued RWD LR, and that still throws down a ~4.9s 0-60."
ferrari,,3,"Exactly.  The richest person I know (probably 200-500M net worth) is incredibly nice, polite, and has spent large chunks of his fortune to help children's organizations, and stuff like that.  He reminds me of Bill Gates, in that it seems like he realizes the best thing he can do is use the money, beyond what he can spend on his own comfort, to help others while he is still around to do it (and set up foundations to do it when he is gone)."
tesla,Tesla,3,"Haha I mean we’ve been running 9s at 150+ mph in the quarter mile with 6,000+ lb 4wd duramaxs since 2008. Not saying it’s safe but as long as you don’t try and comer like it’s an f1 car you’ll be alright. Good for towing a ton of weight with more efficiency than stock and beating on super cars in a straight line for fun! Plus it’s Tesla, they have the highest safety ratings out of any car from my understanding. I’d imagine somewhere the computers won’t allow certain things to happen at high speeds. Just my $0.02"
lucid,,16,"Yeah and the issue is people, for whatever reason, naively believe time and time again that these companies wont take advantage of the position that they built. They will, thats the entire point.   Recent example of this is the whole ai editor thing, all of them on a vc-subsidized race to the bottom, people are going to be disappointed when they start to realize how much the real cost is, its already started to happen."
tesla,Tesla,58,"Most of Tesla design reeks of solutions looking for problems.   Electronically controlled glove box latch. Crazy door handles that get frozen shut in ice. Falcon wing doors that take extra time to open and close. Glass roofs more prone to break. No climate control buttons or knobs.   If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But that's Tesla's problem - they want everything to look cool and futuristic, functionality be damned, because that's their brand and sales proposition."
rollsroyce,,8,"Yup, I agree.  After thinking about it some more since I posted that I think the beginning of the end (or at least start of the transition) was the growth and emergence of Google.    Google made it so there was no longer any of that ""searching"" for the particularly quality content, no more ""word of mouth"" spreading of quality pages online, it was like a natural reddit upvote but for the whole early web.  Once google came around you would just type a word for what you wanted and it would take you there, but 99% of people are not going beyond the top link... and knowing exactly how google adsense works, you'd know being that top link is very easy with a little money.  Even google making billions doing this didnt realize the power they were simply handing away, even for BILLIONS of dollars it was pennies on the dollar value for literally every human interested in a particular idea or concept being forwarded to your page, your sponsored content.  Again, the fact that this is happening to everyone using the web, times the *hundreds of millions of users* makes for a lack of scope and perspective, its hard for a single individual to see this from their own first person POV, its so vast."
tesla,Model S,2,"Hybrid CRV and RAV4 if I had to guess.  People want electric but decide on hybrid in the US because of the depreciation and convenience issues for many people. I bet rental volumes are down too, I think that’s the biggest market for Rogues usually and if they’re tightening up due to economic uncertainty…  Just checked and CRV crushed it (best sales month in history at 46k units) and 54% of its sales were hybrid (all time high)."
tesla,,93,"Completely agree with your points. Here in Aus I do see a number of BYD reviews that are a bit ""too good to be true"", so it's better to rely on word-of-mouth, and so far it seems BYDs are good, but not exceptional cars, and there's nothing wrong with that.   On the other hand, some reviewers seem to have a slight negative ""tint"" to BYD? Like, Top Gear's review of the Dolphin Surf has the headline: ""Nothing we say will stop this car selling like crazy"" which (IMO) is a tiny bit aggressive, and the reviewer doesn't really hide how much he hates the car, although the other big UK outlets are notably more positive towards this car.  I do wonder if BYD has threatened legal action to any of the big reviewers, considering some (like Top Gear) seemingly detest BYD and every car they make."
rollsroyce,,5,The Z06 sounding tame is the craziest thing I’ve heard in a while and the world is incredibly crazy right now.
rollsroyce,,21,"Another thing to consider is a pedal lock, I used one in high school on my civic, i would put it around the clutch pedal. You pull it super tight to the pedal.

lucid,,5,"> Nestled into the southern slopes of the Alps, St. Moritz sits at roughly 6000 feet above sea level. Munich, on the other hand, is located at approximately 1700 feet above sea level, or 4300 feet below St. Moritz. In 2021, we made a similar descent (closer to 6000 feet) from the summit of Pikes Peak to downtown Colorado Springs in a Porsche Taycan to prove just how much gravity helps regenerative braking. Spoiler: it's a big help."
rollsroyce,,22,"The oldest trap in the book, its comical how easily that car can generate some serious repair bills even if you work on it yourself. ABS brake modules are over a grand, the SMG transmission will do anything to un-alive itself, vanos problems galore, and if the previous owner neglected it, its basically ruined forever.  If you take a look at one and its leaking any kind of fluid, run as fast as you can because even 20 grand set aside is not enough. I know someone who had an E60 M5 that was basically a Ship of Theseus in car form, only the engine block and some interior parts remained. The car literally hates you for keeping it among the living lol."
ferrari,,9,"I've lifted both those rear clams.  I have trouble believing that it's a 100 pound difference, but it's very noticeable.  I don't mind lifting the clam on the euro car but I definitely have to think twice before doing it on the US one, and not just because it's broomstick is more cantankerous.   More noticeable -- as you know -- is how much extra bracing there is in the front clam.   The US car can be carefully opened by one person.  The euro version is flexible enough that it always requires two people.   Also, you have to do a side by side comparison to tell, but the euro doors are lighter as well. "
rollsroyce,,3,"I've owned my LR4 for over 8 years now and it's been pretty reliable.  Best car I've ever owned when all things are considered, and that's on a list with multiple Land Cruisers and Jeeps.  Starting with the 05 LR3 and going newer, Land Rover has really gotten a lot more reliable than they used to be, especially once all the BMW stuff was phased out.  Modern Land Rover outsources their parts from the same places that other car manufacturers get their parts.  Starters are Denso, injectors are Bosch, etc. During my 8 years of Land Rover ownership, the people who've come at with me with the ""but Land Rover reliability"" schtick are usually people who have never owned a Land Rover and are just repeating what they've heard (usually from others who've never owned a Land Rover).  If they do have some sort of connection to Land Rover ownership, it's usually a clapped out, undermaintained used one they bought cheap.  After the first-year of a brand new model jitters with the modern D90, all reports are that they've been pretty reliable."
lucid,,18,"And if the M5 had been going at 60 mph instead of 70 mph when the others started it wouldn't have even been close. It was already a pretty arbitrary, contrived scenario to make the E39 cross the line at a similar time as the other two so the idea of the BMW ""winning"" in this scenario seems a bit immaterial. When the starts are so different it's not really a race and more a demonstration of how much faster cars have gotten."
lucid,Lucid,5,"It depends on what you mean by technology. Their technology is more efficient than Tesla by most metrics. Whether any given consumer cares about that aspect is up for debate, but they are head in plenty of areas of technology. They are also behind on plenty of areas of technology, more specifically in terms of software. Plenty of their hardware components are at the very least on par with Tesla though.   While the charging network is great for consumers, Tesla's chargers are not that advanced. Any given charging station is as advanced as any given Tesla charging location. And Lucid's 900v architecture gives Lucid a higher potential in terms of charging than any given Tesla. I don't think this is a tech discussion, it's purely a matter of deployment."
lucid,,14,Some chains have embraced them and host Tesla Superchargers at a lot of locations. Sheetz has a lot of SCs. Do does Caseys and Kum and Go (and I wouldn't have believed that name was real if I didn't see it with my own two eyes).  And it's a brilliant strategy. We're not going to just gas and go. We've got time to kill and money to spend while charging. I did a road trip to the East Coast last year and spent more money at Sheetz locations in one day than I had in my entire life.
rollsroyce,Rolls Royce,91,Rolls Royce is better suited to EV than most premium auto brands. They’re supposed to be quiet and smooth. The EV will improve both those qualities. The Rolls Royce is typically heavy and not great at cornering so it won’t be hurt by going EV. The only downside I’m seeing is the wealthy Rolls Royce owners won’t want to sit at a charging station for an extended period of time to recharge. But I expect battery capacity to increase and charge times to decrease in the coming years anyway.

rollsroyce,,9,"> someone with well adjusted mirrors and is also checking them as frequently as one should would already know whats in their blind spot bc they saw them in their rear view and side mirrors 3seconds ago.  Tell that to the dude doing 55 in a 30 who hit me while I changed lanes coming up from a dip that prevented me from seeing more than a handful of car-lengths back out of my side mirror. My mirrors are adjusted properly and I hadn't seen anything in them, double checked because I wanted to pull into a parking lot right before a light and wanted to make sure I could get all the way across before changing lanes, and BAM! Dude was trying to make the light and floored it.  It's a weird spot so *maybe* I wouldn't have seen him if I'd looked over my shoulder, but I do think I could've seen farther uphill than the strange angle allowed by any/each of my mirrors."

tesla,Model S,0,"It does when your first car wasn't intended for daily duties, gets 15 MPG combined, and was only your daily because it outlasted your previous daily.  But more importantly, we're in a car enthusiast sub. We have, and like to drive, cars. We're going to keep driving cars one way or another. *I* am going to keep driving fun cars. And this is better than any of the alternatives. Substituting something more sustainable isn't perfect, but it's better than *not* substituting something sustainable."
ferrari,Ferrari,15,"It’s probably more about the seller being as transparent as possible. If the seller discloses every single receipt and record they have, all the way down to a tire plug, they present themselves as someone with nothing to hide. If a seller tells me about everything down to a $750 plugged tire I’m feeling pretty good that they didn’t cut corners anywhere else.  Buyer expectations when buying a Ferrari are a little different than buying an ordinary used car."

If I ever get it repainted (and back on the road prior to that) I'm torn between keeping the cobras because they look cool, or back to the v6 ponies.  It wouldn't be much of a sleeper since the sound gives it away something up."
lucid,Lucid,4,"> With that said a new car maker will never come out with a budget car as their first entry because you cant build brand awareness off a entry level car. Halo cars sell cars. So halo cars come out first. That way you have cutting edge tech, class leading range etc. Finally when the cheap one comes out people buy it because of the halo before it.  If that were the only reason to start with a halo model, Tesla wouldn’t have had so many issues trying to start Model 3 and Model Y production.    Designing to a price point is hard.  Pushing a new technology down to a price point it’s never existed at before is even harder.  Producing the resulting product without sacrificing quality is harder still.  Legacy automakers with decades of experience in car design still struggle with QA and affordability even in ICE vehicles.  They’ve not done any worse with EVs so far, but they also haven’t done any better - even Porsche, as expensive as the Taycan is, has not managed to put forward a completely trouble-free product.  Tesla may only be profitable because of other businesses secondary to their carmaking operation, but the fact even the “giant” of the EV sector isn’t having a good time of it should be an indication that the mass market is not going to be as easy a nut for Lucid or Rivian to crack as you think it will be."

rollsroyce,,9,"lol, reminds me of a guy that showed up to a Richmond VA C&C with Montana plates on his Heritage GT. The running joke was how amazing, somebody drove all the way from Montana for the Richmond C&C and even went to the trouble of having the car detailed for the show. By the same token I know another guy that got a GT and when he was hit with 10k in PPT ended up getting Montana plates. No excuse in either case but property taxes can certainly gate a vehicle (and heaven forbid somebody in the peasant class wins an expensive vehicle, they'll be able to drive it right up until they sell it to cover the personal property taxes).  The out of state plates are bad but the guys that DGAF are the farm use tag guys."

tesla,Tesla,62,"Gearheads in this thread are now suddenly worried about safety. Which I believe makes it a first in automotive history - tesla actually scared some car enthusiasts into being codgy old men/women, waving their sticks about how stupid newfangled technology is and how we all need to be safe while proudly sporting their credentials for driving at well over the speed limit in their $120k sports cars.   These are likely the same people who would sit on a bucket with no seat belt if they thought the weight reduction would get them behind the wheel of a sub-10 second car."

A ""factoid"" is technically an incorrect piece of information that people think is a fact because ""everyone says so."" Which leads to this fun little thing where ""factoid"" IS a factoid!!   On the flip-side, common usage has diluted the meaning, so you could technically argue that I'm wrong, but I'm going with the original definition here.      ...Back to Hyundai N cars though, they're so awesome and I would love a Veloster N but there's so much tarnishing their reputation at the moment.

lucid,Lucid,41,"Ok, there's actually some interesting stuff to unpack here:  The market cap this morning is $13.34 billion. The compensation package was:  >Rawlinson received a $379 million compensation package in 2022 for his role at the luxury EV maker Lucid, including a $575,000 base salary, $5.5 million of stock options, and an incredible $373 million in stock awards  &#x200B;  Wait, so the CEO received 2.8% of the company just for working there a year? Of course, we don't know how the contract is written, but if he receives a fixed amount of shares per year, and if the company doesn't issue more shares, he'd receive 28% of the company if he works there for a decade?  That's insane. What kind of company does that? This kind of stock based compensation is typically only for really, really shitty startups. Does Lucid not think they'll last long term and they're just hoping for a buyout?  &#x200B;  EDIT: In comparison, Ford's Farley got $16 million in stock this year. That's 0.03% of the company at today's market cap, a more typical number. What kind of board at Lucid permitted their CEO compensation scheme LOL."
porsche,,4,i used ai for this list but kinda lines up with what id guess
tesla,,26," >	Managing dealers is a cost auto makers don't want to shoulder  That doesn’t make sense. If dealerships can sell cars at X price and make a profit while shouldering all the operating costs, car companies can sell cars at the same X price and shoulder the same operating costs.  In reality they’d be able to sell at X - dealership profit, since the store operation itself would not be for profit.   The dealership model is a lose lose situation for both automakers and consumers, the only party benefiting from it is the dealership."

Which is why I got a ridgeline because 95% of the time I'm driving it, it's to get to work or groceries or whatnot. The other 5% is to haul my motorcycle to the track, go skiing, or go camping.  And this is where the cybertruck would make sense.  I will say those stats surprised me though, I figured it was a low number but I didn't realize it was that low.  I live in Maryland though and most people who have trucks around here have them for a reason because parking can be a bitch."

tesla,,6,"You're talking about so many different ways of measuring horsepower here. New cars are **not** rated at the wheels. Even on the same dyno you can have one vehicle put down 300 rear whp through a power robbing automatic with a high stall torque converter, heavy duty rear end, and big tires and another FWD car put down 300 whp through a much less power hungry manual and differential. Both engines, if removed from their respective vehicles and tested on an engine dyno, will show the one putting down power through the heavier drivetrain makes considerably more power.  Rating an engine, with accessories attached, in a controlled environment, measured at the crankshaft will give the most accurate, repeatable ratings. That's why it's done that way today. Every time you attach something after that you're introducing more and more variables. Even chassis dynos will differ not just from manufacturer to manufacturer but from location to location. Some dyno operators won't use any atmospheric data for correction, some will use STD standards, some will use SAE standards.  I wouldn't at all be surprised if an old 426 Hemi made a legitimate 400 hp at the crankshaft if it was rated the same way a new Camaro or Mustang was. Same with a Boss 429. Trapping in the mid 10X range in a 4000 lb car means you're putting out more hp than a Honda Odyssey V6."
rollsroyce,,16,"I can see your point. But again, what someone else does with their car doesn't effect me.

Imagine driving down the road in your pride and joy (whatever that car may be) and some idiot giving you shit for lowering your car, or putting stickers on your car, your spoilers too big, tinting the windows, plastidipping your rims, etc... That shits just straight up uncalled for.  You can laugh at someone else's car to yourself but don't disrespect the car or the person like the idiots in this video did. "
tesla,Tesla,14,"I really just don't understand the argumentative nature when it comes to stuff like this.   Ok, so you want to make sure it's correct for the record books, I get that, but the finger pointing and comments like ""I bet it can't break 10 seconds"" and acting as if that's a massive failure or something is just silly.  You can almost tell who grew up with these sort of numbers, and those of us who remember that a 10 second car meant a built Camaro, or Mustang, with a cage, race gas, drag radials, and was completely undriveable in daily life. I knew guys in high school who chased that 10 second number and never broke it. This era we're living in is fucking BANANAS! A stock 4 door family sedan is running 10 second 1/4 miles. I don't care if you hate elon, the EV market, or whatever, that's fucking mind blowing.  I remember watching Top Gear back in the mid 2000s, along with reading magazine articles about how the cars of that era were probably going to be the last of it's kind. No more big power, and how we should enjoy the swan song of muscle cars and supercars, because regulations wouldn't allow more powerful and faster cars in the upcoming years.  Now, there's people arguing and shit talking Tesla that it can't do a sub 10 sec 1/4 unless it has a prepped surface. Prepped, not prepped, stock, not stock tires, who cares! You can order a family sedan that is running 9s/10s. Let that shit sink in for a second."

Some normal people would probably be floored if you took a photo with them and their car, and then a year later (at christmas or whatever) sending that photo in a card to their house. Hand written saying something like, Thank you for being our customer, let me know if you need anything at all.   The above statement is nearly free (your dealership could buy a printer and a decent point and shoot camera and 100$ a year in cards and you're good).   Sometimes effort>money spent  I work in sales myself, (not car sales, but business to business sales), and people know why you're contacting them. In your note there is no reason to say anything like ""If you want to check out our latest models"" or ""I'll be here if you want a test drive""  or any of that nonsense. Just say hi, and thank you.

tesla,,6,"They're good, tbh.  My mom has a 2022 Escape plug-in. It has something like 39 miles of electric range. She charges it off of 110V at home and it's always ready to go the following morning. I think the last time we checked her fuel consumption it was over 100mpg. Just because *so much* driving people really do is just around town stuff. Having the ability to go further when you want is nice and eliminates range anxiety, but having a decent EV range and being able to drive on electric only is a game changer."
bentley,Bentley,11,A torque converter. A Bentley should be smooth first and foremost. One of the few - albeit minor - widespread criticisms of the Continental GT and Flying Spur is that the dual clutch makes them clunky at low speeds which is inconsistent with the ultra-luxury image. Bentley did everything they could to engineer it out but that's just a weakness of dual clutches.
lucid,Lucid,4,"Ahhh lane keep. Very good point. One of those things I don't have a personal need for so my anecdotal experience missed it. The lack of sentry mode is another (hopefully they can afford to do cellular car camera access at some point).  I use my Lucid more or less just for my daily work commute, which does not involve a freeway or public parking. If it did, these would've been much bigger footnotes from me. Good you brought it up.  I toyed around with the atmos system. It was very cool, but I had the same thought - Model S system sounds a solid few notches better. Most things in this band do frankly. I think the Lucid's sound systems are one of the most obviously cut corners in the whole product tbh (next to needing a charger mailed lol). They sound like the speakers in higher trim Hondas. Not terrible sound system by any means - but it really does need to be a priority for future model years. Lacks heart and no luxury car should have fewer than fiver sliders on its EQ. We're past those days."
porsche,,6,"I like to think of it as shared anecdotal knowledge helping to prevent people from repeating the mistakes of others.  In my opinion, there is no excuse for BMWs to fall apart like yours did.  People are going to bring up the fact that it's a luxury car as if it absolves BMW of any responsibility, but I call bullshit on that seeing as under-the-hood components and gaskets are failing.  Just look at Lexus for solid proof that you can build a luxury car that doesn't crap out.  There is no secret Lexus sauce that you dribble over every part before it is installed, it's just a combination of well-designed and well-built components, a different approach to product development and the Toyota Production System.  Lexus isn't perfect and I can find plenty of things I don't like about them, but being unreliable isn't one of those, at least."

Maybe there were more messages on other platforms, but you'd think that would be in the article if it were a large number. If he got 2000 threats that would be significant, but if he got 3 threats that's pretty much a normal day on the Internet."

tesla,Tesla,30,Motors are cheap.    Nobody knows what it will cost from Tesla since they're all still under warranty but used prices are roughly $3k and usually used prices are higher than direct from Tesla (there's this weird belief that Tesla doesn't sell parts so the used market is full of people buying them and marking up for Ebay folks that believe it).  it's less the cost to me than the fact that my most reliable unit so far lasted 3 years.

We live in a town with only one BMW dealership and I chalked it up to no area competition, but then I’ve seen and heard too many stories like your own. In 2012 we bought a “new” 2013 X5  M package with less than 1000 miles on it at a good deal since we threatened legal action on the first car. Things were fine at first, but as soon as the car needed work, they failed us again.

However, either way:  Completely unacceptable when a Mustang 5.0, with more power!, puts it all down on corner exit (so, still turning) in fucking second gear. Porsche GTS puts it all down in FIRST gear with only marginally less power, on bald tires in somewhat cold conditions."
tesla,Model S,3,"At this point you're kinda relying on old data.  One thing you need to realize is that many companies are dropping billions of dollars into improving EVs, and they are still a nascent industry, so they are getting better all the time.  Therefore, most of what you said is being invalidated as we speak.  The new Model S does have better charging times.  It is 200 miles in 15 minutes now.  Obviously still not as good but it is improving, although I don't think it'll ever hit the speed of filling with gasoline.  That said, for day to day use, it is much faster to just plug it in at home or work compared to stopping by a gas station.    They also spoke of 30-40% improvements in cold weather due to new designs in their heat pump and such.  Range degradation in cold weather should be much less in these new vehicles."

But honestly, a lot of the kind of shenanigans that dealers get up to are done with the tacit blessing of the manufacturer.  The dealership model just gives them plausible deniability.    At least Tesla owns their role in the entire process, however good or bad their performance in the whole delivery and post-purchace interactions are."

tesla,Tesla,19,">That being said, people do dumb shit in cars all the time, this one just happened to be in a Tesla. For example, how many idiots kill people street racing? Should manufacturers and aftermarket companies be held liable? Tesla knows this is a slippery slope.  Why is this a poor argument?   1. Because it doesn't address the original point:   >but from a safety point of view, Tesla has done the absolute barest minimum job of detecting driver engagement. Everyone else has adopted cameras for this task, while tesla continues to rely on torque sensing that is easily duped.   Tesla has a flawed way of monitoring driver attention when the car is driving itself. Other companies like GM and Ford have since found a better way of monitoring driver attentiveness and warning the driver to re-take control of their vehicle. The government is behind on self-driving regulations for automotive safety and as a result, we have companies like Tesla that cut costs at the expense of driver safety by not implementing the better driver monitoring and alert system.  2. No one made the argument that street racing a vehicle makes the manufacturer liable, but I think everyone could agree that there should be regulations on the liability of the manufacturer when it comes to self-driving systems. The government has plenty of regulations on how software and hardware in a vehicle is supposed to function in regards to customer safety. Self-driving systems are no different, they can and should be regulated to some degree.  >Should manufacturers and aftermarket companies be held liable?  Sometimes, yes."

My comment was referencing that perhaps the person was looking at the used car market, meaning g they obviously wouldnt have a choice in their transmission and perhaps the overall amount of automatic options would be less apart from some higher end makes which only offer their vehicles on auto (or their owners are more likely to spec it).

But I agree -- it's honestly not a bad deal, especially for a 911 or Cayman where a 2-din stereo doesn't fit without a $170 trim piece anyways. Depending on what you get, I'd say that a third-party stereo from Best Buy or something with equivalent features would be $7-900. So plus the trim piece, about $1k.

The receptionists also made me a coffee and brought over a small cake to have with it. All for about $250, for someone my age it would be more expensive to hire an RC350 for the day anyway.  They even took me through the dealership and let me get up close and personal with their LFA and have a sit in and chat about the LC500 and pristine LS430 they had on the floor.  I fucking love Lexus dealers."

The other companies need to either up their game and get better performance or differntiate themselves from a Tesla (imo taycan is most likely to do this), not a tesla fan, but they are doing well with this"
tesla,,5,"If you look at Porsche's other models there's a huge gap between the pricing of the top spec model and the base model. For example the Panamera, here in the UK, starts at £72k. A bit of playing around with the options and it's possible to spend over £200k on one (£149k+options).  The Panamera is probably the closest thing to the Taycan in the current Porsche range, so I'd not be at all surprised if the base model when it's out is around that £80-90k mark."
lucid,,4,">Modern ICE cars just don't have that much character, outside of a few very high-dollar examples. What character is there is often purposefully engineered in, too. For instance, the LT1 in a C7 runs way rougher than the LS1 in a C5, which is really weird when you stop and think about how much more advanced it is. LS1 cars won't pop and burble like a C7 either, how strange, they just run smoothly like an EFI car ought to...  Define ""character"""

lucid,,4,I owned the 350z for many years and loved it so I am probably a good demographic. It starts at 40k whereas the 350 and 370 started at right around $30k. Additionally you need to kick in another 10k to get the (iirc) LSD and bigger brakes which is pretty steep IMO. Finally when I looked around the only colors anywhere near me in manual were gray. I've seen maybe 2 on the road so far. I'd probably comparison shop the Supra.    Edit: Forgot to mention the markups are so high you might as well look at a Porsche Cayman

Enough said about his stupidity.  The model S stops from 60mph to zero in a very short 105-110 feet.  Those are pretty good brakes.  Take any regular car and drive it on the track with some hard braking, and the brakes will fall apart very quickly.  The brakes on the S are more than enough for street driving, even when you do short burst of full power acceleration.  And if you want tracking capability, you get the upgraded brakes in the track package, just like any street car would need to."
tesla,Tesla,54,"Who knew an industry that took huge corporations decades to refine their production lines at every angle is difficult to break into. The Japanese car manufacturers and their achievements in mass production and QC should never be underestimated, something it seem many Tesla investors/fanboys seem to deliberately ignore. These companies survive in an extremely competitive industry because they are good at what they do - or they get bailed out by the US government.  Building luxury cars at expensive prices in small volumes are far easier than creating a production line that can build thousands and thousands of cars at an affordable prices, at a quality that won't fall apart after 30,000 miles. It is a completely different beast. Entire careers of the smartest people in the world are spent perfecting these production lines, improving quality by 0.1 % there and reducing cost by a couple of dollars here. The sneers and jeers by these Tesla fanboys are really grating in this context. Absolutely no respect."

I was even asked to help do “pro drives” at those super car events because of auto x.

bentley,,3,"You don't even have to be that rich to live on the water.  But it should be noted that just because you live on the water or even have a dock that you'll keep your boat there. For instance I use to have a dock but I kept my boat at a marina a few miles away. The boat was a 36' searay (I think, it's been several years since I had it) and the river I lived on wasn't deep enough during low tide for the boat to pass (especially with all the debris that is on the bottom of that river).  So there's lots of reasons you'd keep your boat in a marina rather than docked at your house. Plus it's just kind of easier to get maintenance done on your boat if its at a marina."

Also Waymo has a bad future ahead of it, with its CEO jumping ship, and their business plan to... retrofit chrysler vehicles... Meanwhile Intels mobileye has secured 13/15 of the top manufactures and a ton of the startups like NIO. Considering they are only going to start autonomous taxi's next year, they are probably a bit behind in tech, but they have the support and profitability Waymo lacks. Also Google has a bad track record of supporting products. I wouldnt be surprised if they scraped any take on consumer cars and tried to push for trucking or a military contract."

Both of those things can be true. An excellent example is my last car: 2021 VW GTI. Ask any GTI enthusiast, and they say resoundingly that the mk7/mk7.5 GTI is the best VW ever made, top tier quality, etc., and I had nothing but problems with that car. Interior rattles, interior panels that would shake, the ""soundaktor"" speaker literally blew itself out, etc."

The fact that even on an unprepped surface this full size family sedan can go 0-60 faster than literally every automobile on the planet that isn't some multimillion dollar hypercar.  This is why I like electrical motors more than ICE and diesel engines. Doesn't matter the application. Electrical motors are more efficient while weighing less. Instant-full torque at 1 RPM is superior to waiting for engine RPM to catch up to max torque.

porsche,,3,"Exactly. It's brought up because it absolutely is a valid consideration.   Generally the people bothered by it being mentioned seem to be the ones who haven't considered it, or aren't comfortable with it.   Yes, a $5k macbook will depreciate faster. But it's a 5k investment.   A 50k vehicle may not depreciate as fast %-wise, but within 3 years you're probably able to buy 4 5k macbooks with the depreciation alone - so you absolutely should be considering the loss of value and whether it's something you're happy to live with.  Unaffordable or unpalatable depreciation is why people buy corvettes and only drive them to church on a Sunday - if you're worried about driving a vehicle because of the depreciation, it absolutely needs to be considered as a factor in the purchase, and hiding behind ""being an enthusiast"" or ""other people not letting us enjoy our interest by mentioning depreciation"" wreaks of insecurity about the decision."

It is not in the least ""unbelievable"" to see a Chinese company racking up supply chain debts and slave working conditions. Most Asian manufacturers juggle payment terms, government supported funding and zombie loans (basically loans that only ever pay interest and gets extended indefinitely) to stay afloat. I spent the past five years transitioning away from those three things because COVID hit us hard and nobody thought we'd ever survive it. If the global manufacturing chain was forced to an American style of capital and currency management we'd all end up with sackcloths and typewriters."

bentley,,18,"The End of the Seat brand is said to be a possibility, not a must. Looking at recent Seat concept cars I guess they are aiming for a new brand identity including a new name, because the old one is connected to cheap superminis in most peoples minds. According to Herbert Diess Seat is only selling well in Spain, Germany and the UK.  The duality of two entry-level brands made sense in the early 2000s when Skodas were blunt and conservative looking transportation devices and Seat the fresh and spicy brand for younger folks. Both were aiming at totally different customer groups, but with all cars (even Skodas) becomming more ""sporty"" (looking) in the last decade and both Seat and Skoda developing fully grown model ranges, they ended up directly competing each other.  I never realy liked the design of Skodas, but looking closer at them they remind me on older VWs from the 80s and 90s before VW moved up-market. A bit generic looking but very solidly made cars that were just plain cars. But I guess just isn't enough anymore in times where most cars of most manufacturers become more and more simular. ""Brand identity"" is often the most significant difference between competing models nowdays, especially within the VW family."

Basically take out any normal features you would expect in a car that's going to be $80K with taxes and that's the base trim. They clearly don't want anybody actualy buying it, the Touring trim is the first trim that has normal luxury features and it's $20K more.

The dealer that ours gets serviced through is definitely more of a hassle than is liked.   The other issue is that the engine has the well known valve tick now. If the car sits for a day or two it sounds awful on startup, but it gets better after its warmed up.  After 4 days at the dealer they said it was fixed but nothing changed. Just hope it doesn't grenade right out of warranty.   Overall it is a fantastic car, the power and features are great, and the pricing is really competitive against its rivals.  I think the dealer issues are whats going to plague the brand until it get sorted out."

Hell, even my headphones (HD600's + decent AMP/DAC) beat any car audio I've ever heard, and it's not even close. That setup is something most people could achieve for ~$4-500.  When it comes to cars, as long as the quality isn't horrendous, I don't really care. It will never approach my home setup, so I wouldn't be interested in blowing additional money on it.

Alternatively a higher tech but less pure version made by Koenigsegg using freevalve and a MGU-H style turbo would also be interesting.

tesla,Tesla,49,"Many also think they do, whether that's true or not.  There are a lot of Tesla fans that view owning Tesla vehicles as owning a small piece of the Tesla brand. Unlike the vehicle, whose value can be determined semi-objectively, the brand's value is determined by how many people are *extremely hyped about it*. In that frame, criticisms of the vehicle aren't bad because they make you feel bad about your purchase, they're bad because you might dehype someone listening and therefore devalue the thing they really care about.  There's a reason the overlap between cryptocurrency people and Tesla superfans is so large: you need the hype machine mindset to achieve peer prominence in either camp."

Every EV except the Polestar 2, and every single Tesla. In fairness, some of those Teslas are a single digit mile off the EPA rating, but some are also 10 or 15% off. Sure, it's not an EPA test, but when every other EV can match or comfortably exceed the EPA rating....  The Taycan 4S is a ridiculous 60% up on its EPA rating. Granted, not a Turbo like OPs, but still.  Sure, the precise mileage number may be an estimate on both, but it seems that you have a better chance of hitting the rated number in basically anything that isn't a Tesla."

porsche,Porsche,3,"A lot of bickering about who is at fault, but at the end of the day it will come down to the Police officer who writes up the accident.  They will consider the rules of the road, not the rules of the racetrack.  It will probably be something like 75% BMW/25% Porsche if I had to speculate, but really it's a guess.  And the insurance mess will be very complicated, Misha said that UK insurance companies will likely go after the owner (BMW) for the money afterwards (will probably be well in excess of $100,000)."
bentley,,9,"I've seen a vid in yt about process of making switches and buttons for cars, it's a lengthy and  costly process. Dumping everything on the screen saves manufacturers thousands of dollars plus they can charge extra for different sizes."
rollsroyce,,4,"All of that is separate to the reality of people's complaints. It's not ""throw away all screens."" It's an annoyance how touchscreen are being used as an excuse to remove physical controls. It's about how screens are replacing physical gauges and often being slapped into the trendy wide-screen displays that combine a gauge cluster into the infotainment in a vertical screen that is an eyesore with no integration to the design of the car's interior.  Using a poorly center stack from 15 years ago, despite having a screen, does not fit your argument well at all. There was a screen, but the design was awful, so screens are clearly not an objective solution to interior designs that look good (especially well into the future). Using that image of an ugly interior with a screen to argue in favor of screens doesn't make sense."
bentley,,5,"I'll second this. The Range Rover is a very pleasant place to sit. But it's not a breathtaking place to sit. It's not as cocooning and isolating. It's not quite as thoughtful. It's luxury, but it's not ""I've made it and fuck the world"" luxury. The Bentayaga is.  Also, I think this is more Jaguar owners in one place than I've ever seen in /r/cars. Nice to know we're all pretentious douchecanoes, and it's not just me."

porsche,,9,"That’s the way American dealers handle things. They cheap out on everything to save a dime instead of helping their customers. They don’t even realize that is screwing them in the end game because it makes you feel like you don’t wanna come back and do service with them if they treat you poorly. On top of all that, the service advisor didn’t even know what the hell he was talking about.   SA’s are literally worthless and I never really take anything they say seriously because 90% of the time, if they’re an SA in a dealership, they just do it for the money. They don’t have a passion or knowledge for cars, they’re just the purgatory line to spew BS at you and try to make you happy lol. "
bentley,,7,"The passenger seatbelt warning in my Passat. I can put my backpack, groceries, books, tools, whatever manner of heavy items on the passenger seat and nothing happens, but put my phone there and the seatbelt warning chime immediately comes on (and scares the shit out of me because I think something has gone wrong.)  Also, annoyingly, if I have MAX AC set to on when I shut the car off, next time I start it, all the climate controls are reset with AC off."
bentley,,14,"The story I wrote cut down events a bit to make it interesting to read. I had it idling in the driveway for a good 5 minutes while I looked at everything and skimmed through the manual in the glove compartment. Also taking it out of driveway, at first it was just a burst to 60 mph. I didn’t truly take it pedal to the floor until I drove about 5-7 minutes more towards a highway, then when I hit the on-ramp I punched it there. I didn’t check the temps but it had been idling/driving for about 10-12 minutes at that point."
lucid,,16,"86’s are great, but there’s something about the tier of car the Supra plays in that puts it on another level for me. It’s a lot more expensive, a lot more work because it’s a lot more punishing, but it’s also a lot more capable, and therefore a lot more rewarding when I hit that perfect apex without spinning out. PB’s are a constant development as a driver and that’s what makes track driving fun to me. Tires are getting more expensive as I get faster though, and I think I’ve hit the point where time improvements are hindered by lack of downforce than lack of power or lack of driving ability."

porsche,,5,"I love the concept of a corvette. They’re absolute performance monsters, but, and this is my personal opinion:  They’re too big. In a non widebody modern vette I feel like I’m taking up the whole road, like I’m on a train with rails. They’re wide and they’re heavy. I can’t  even imagine a z06 etc. I prefer my cars to be much smaller, so the cayman, M2, supra are the cars I’m dreaming of (currently driving a BRZ which is the perfect size for a sports car imo)  The c8 is of course the better car than (anything near it in price), but it’s not the car I would enjoy the most."
rollsroyce,,12,"Same here I'm fairly sneaky at recognizing certain moves and what people want to do and I'll block your ass without you even realizing I did it on purpose, without being an asshole.  I agree though, keep a steady pace without unnecessary braking.  I see so many people braking far too often when all they had to do is let off the gas.  You break, the person behind you brakes longer, and so on until some dude is parked 5 miles behind you. "

lucid,,4,"By that logic manufacturers are also over engineering ICE cars. New features are being added to ICE cars too, and this has been happening since the 1880s. In any case, it is not something to worry about too much since soon most car manufacturers will be making EVs and before long most cars on the road will likely be EVs.  Here is another point of view that might you see EVs in a different light:  According to BP, one of the largest oil companies in the world, earth has about 50 years worth of known fossil fuels at current usage levels. If we use it all up, we will have none left in case of a civilisational collapse that requires access to cheap and rugged energy that we might need to reboot civilisation. Keep in mind that that is for current usage levels, which are without doubt going to increase.  Also keep in mind that we have no marketable solution for alternative power sources in airplanes, and that we will probably still want military vehicles to run on liquid fuel that is independent of a grid. We really cannot afford to burn fossil fuels in cars if there is an alternative, which there is.  EVs will also lessen dependency on foreign oil imports, which in a world with mounting international tension, is a huge guarantor of safety and independence for countries who can generate their own electricity. Relying on fossil fuels is a matter of national security for most Western nations, although this is rarely discussed in favour of the environmental arguments."
ferrari,,3,"Also the E92 M3 (V8 S65)does hold price better than the E60 M5 (V10 S85).  The M3 is more expensive at this point despite it being nowhere as rare or unique.    This is a bit odd but understandable. Both engines have 80% of the same problems, the S85 has some uglier issues with its unique Vanos setup and ionic ignition that are costly maintenance. But V10 power and noise! The issue the M5 has is the SMG which is a huge POS, I have a manual and a SMG.   The M3 has more fanboyism and is more reliable because it doesn’t have the SMG. More demand means higher values. That’s ok like wrenching on my 500hp, 200mph cheap M5 despite all her flaws. I’d much rather have a CTS-V manual wagon tho, but in ain’t paying +50k"
tesla,,4,"I'm really considering leasing, something I never thought I would do. I just started a new job that's a 50 minute trip each way and my wife and I just had a daughter. Not sure if we're going to have more kids, not sure how much I'll be needing to go to work in-person post-pandemic, so what I need now might not be what I need in 4-5 years. Between that and the fact that leases are so ridiculously cheap right now, I'd definitely spend less per year on a lease. And realistically, after \~3 years, whatever I buy might have depreciated more from the purchase price than what I spent on a lease over that same time."
porsche,Porsche,3,"I don’t blame them for it, the whole situation just rubs me the wrong way. Toyota didn’t bring back the Supra because they love the car, and even if ‘the people on the inside who love it’ did, they should’ve stopped if they knew Toyota was going to turn it into a cash grab. They didn’t bring back that car we all know and love, they just took a bmw, repackaged it, and sold it to enthusiasts in an attempt to fool people into giving them money for a car that really isn’t all that special. The mr2 is no different. Yeah, sure the chief engineer might love the legacy of the car and its spirit, but if the higher ups are just going to have him repackage a Porsche Boxster, why would he even want to go through with it? There’s no passion there, no care for the actual car there. It’s just a couple of cronies finding a way to make a quick buck."
bentley,,6,"I’ve worked in car audio for the past decade and I can tell you that all but the top 1% of stock premium systems are nothing but smoke and mirrors and nowhere near audiophile quality. 99% of them still use paper speakers, junk amplification, zero sound deadening, and legit awful source units. Ever wonder why they make 19 speaker systems when the best home audio systems use 2? Yeah it’s just to flood the car interior with over-EQ’d mediocre sound to give the impression of good sound to people on a test drive.   You can buy a couple $79 pairs of aftermarket speakers, a $129 head unit, a $199 4 channel amp, and $75 worth of sound deadening and make your 15 year old Honda Accord sound better than 99% of factory premium systems with just an afternoon worth of work. Honestly those same $79 speaker pairs connected straight to the $129 head unit will sound better than most of those factory premium systems, especially when playing music from a CD or USB drive rather than over Bluetooth.   And of course a $1000 aftermarket setup, properly installed and tuned, will sound better than *anything* car manufacturers offer."

bentley,,12,"Your salesman sounds like a really good one! I love hearing stories about other sales pros who give our industry a GOOD name, as opposed to the ones that make us all look bad. I think that the advent of the Internet Age has shined a light on who's good and who's bad thanks to review sites like Cars.com and DealerRater...I hope that a decade from now, all of the bad guys have been driven out completely by them. One can dream...  EXCELLENT point about hearing of recalls from the dealer before you hear it from the internet...this is an issue at most if not all dealers, and it really needs to change. It's funny, I've heard folks tell me about a bunch of ""normal"" stores that have awesome customer benefits, but not about a lot of luxury stores. Kind of weird, right? Thanks a ton for your input, pvera!"
porsche,,9,"I never said you should hoard every penny. When it comes to cars, it’s about trying to hoard a few tens of thousands dollars more. As a person who’s growing into his 30s with wealthy friends, I can say that cars alone definitely don’t bring you happiness. Neither does a $2M house. The community, the friends and what you do with your car brings you real happiness. You may enjoy the extra pizazz, horsepower and tightness of a brand new m3 over a used one, but the extra 60k you’re spending up front and the extra 40k you’ll lose relative to the older m3 in depreciation in the next 4 years - can buy you a lot of experiences, lessons, life value that can be - in particular - leveraged and enjoyed while you are still young.  An extra 10-20k saved and used on travel (not necessarily extravagant), language learning, sports coaching, cooking lessons, a nice bicycle, skiing lessons(and passes) in your 20s and 30s is enormously more useful, and (imo) fun compared to owning a brand new well specced m3 over an e90 m3.  That being said, if the choice is between a 25k new civic and a 30k c6 corvette, you’re not really being nearly as irresponsible by picking the corvette. I’d pick the vette any day"

porsche,Porsche,3,Sounds like OC means the strategy Car and Driver uses to justify including very expensive trims that are essentially a different car from the base model. It's just most egregious with Porsche due to the price spread of their models. 
tesla,Model S,3,Are you the most basic ass version of an /r/cars stereotype?
ferrari,,15,"Not bad, not good. McLaren doesn't have first model year bugs, they have first few model years bugs after major platform updates (they switch the model name and add a bit more power every few years, but the model is fundamentally the same for a long time). I wouldn't buy one that's been out for less than 4-5 years. The 12C was the most infamous, but all of their models have this problem. Lambos, on the other hand, aren't any more or less reliable than the Audis whose parts they use, what you take that to mean depends on your opinion of Audi quality. They're just a lot more expensive to fix than Audis when they do break, which you don't have a problem with if you can afford a Lambo.  If you want maximum quality and durability but don't mind not standing out too much, Porsche would be #1 there. The only thing is, they must be GENAU PÜNKTLICH GEPFLEGT or they turn into unsalvageable basketcases. Do it down to the exact mile, don't even drive to the dealer if you'll be over the mileage interval when you get there, and treat ""recommended"" items as if they're as essential as oil changes. Nowhere else can you get a supercar that will be perfectly reliable and feel like new for 300k+ miles, but you sure have to work for it."

ferrari,,96,"The biggest ""hack"" was working for Jalopnik. Back when I started working for Jalopnik in 2013 I was convinced all I ever wanted to do was be a writer. I got an e-mail from a reader saying ""you should make videos"" so I was like... eh, OK, I'll give this a shot.   The Jalopnik columns drove traffic to my videos, which in turn convinced YouTube to start indexing me higher. One day, sitting on my couch in 2015, I realized I was getting more views on the videos than on my Jalopnik columns, and I should probably start focusing more on videos. And now here we are."
porsche,,14,"I see cars as consumables more than assets. If I drive it long enough (and I drive a LOT) it will be worth nothing, that's a consumable to me.  That old Corolla might depreciate more, but it'll need some repairs, will protect me less in case of crash, and generally speaking will be just the worst to drive around.  I'm choosing to invest more money in this part of my budget because it matters to me. Others go to restaurant more often than me, that depreciate a LOT more."
bentley,Bentley,39,"There is so much bad information offered here I had to butt in.     First, there is nothing magical about these cars.  They are big, heavy, powerful and have lots of expensive parts in them, and they aren't well understood but they are just cars.      RR/B incorporated and licensed a lot of parts and systems from other manufacturers instead of designing their own.  Here is a list:     1) Fuel injection:  Bosch K-jet, identical to a Mercedes W126 V8.  Most parts are interchangeable.     2) Transmission:  GM TH400 with a unique pan-mounted dipstick.  Other than the pan, nothing special about it except that gear selecting is done by a Rolls-Royce built electric motor.   3) Alternator, A/C compressor, power steering - All GM.   4) Brakes:  Citroen licensed mechanically pressurized hydraulic.  Dual front calipers but each wheel uses a L and R British Leyland caliper/pad from I think a Triumph.       They are very well built cars, but in the Rolls-Royce tradition they use 4 parts or fasteners where 2 would do, so everything takes a long time to take apart an reassemble.  They are also not optimized for service/repair.  Mercedes would machine out a dimple in the intake manifold you can access a hose clamp, Bentley simply says ""Remove intake manifold it access hose clamp.""     Everyone will warn you about the braking system.  It is complicated but offers incredible performance and stopping power.  It is very unforgiving of neglect, but stories of $15,000 brake jobs are the result of years of willful neglect.     With the car on a lift, carefully inspect all the braided steel brake hoses, there are 18-30 depending on the model.  If they are leaking or weeping, they need to be replaced.  Familiarize yourself with the de-pressurization and bleeding process first.    Don't buy the new hoses from RR or even Flying Spares for $100-180 each.  Take the old hose to your local hydraulic shop and they will make new ones for you from the fittings for $25 each.     This is an amazing resource for understanding the RR Braking system:   https://www.rrsilvershadow.com/ETechn/Hydr/Remintro.htm      Unfortunately, these cars have a bad reputation because most of the ones I've seen in the US have deferred maintenance, due to the North American attitude towards car repair:  ""I'll get a few more miles out of it an fix it when it breaks.""   That isn't how these cars were designed to be used.     They were designed to be used and serviced like aircraft - follow the service schedule, pay what it costs, and it will last forever.  There are planes from the 1930's still in service, and there are lots of Rolls and Bentleys from the same era still on the road.     They are designed for cost-no-object maintenance for people who might carefully review the invoice for servicing their Learjet but not even glance at the car repair bill because it has two less zeroes.       For the DIY owner, they take a lot of time and some money but it's not as bad as it's made out to be.  They tend to appeal to people who like mechanical puzzles.  Most of the people in the RROC that I've met are either wealthy adventurous types who dabble in DIY, or engineers/retired engineers who delight in learning about and mastering the mechanical wizardry.     Your cheap mechanic sounds risky, as there is simply no way to rush through service and repair.  Some parts do have to be ordered from Flying Spares so if you need to have it fixed *today* that could be problematic.       One thing that caught me by surprise on my car was that it started leaking fuel one day, badly.  It turns out the fuel system seals/O-rings are sensitive to ethanol on fuel and will wear out and leak.  The ensuing back to front fuel system rebuild ended up costing about $6,000 to switch over to viton seals.  I'm not sure if your Bosch K-jet car will need that, but my Zytek injection Continental R did.  It might be a '92 onwards problem.     I'd suggest joining the RROC and making use of their online forums.  This will help you understand the car, and if your mechanic the type to research and ask for advice online it will help him too.     Let me know if you have specific questions.  I've put 20,000 miles on a 1994 Continental R and I've done a fully DIY mechanical refresh of a '79 Silver Wraith (LWB Shadow)."
rollsroyce,,9,"I'm not a Mopar person but that car is seriously cool. That sort of story is something you'll never get to experience today. Everyone (in the auto enthusiast world at least) knows what each manufacturer is offering, everyone knows what each car is capable out of the showroom and what can be done with it with simple mods. Not only that but no one really had modified street cars capable of running an 8s 1/4 mile back in the day. I could go out buy a Hellcat, and some dude down the block with an LS Swap Turbo Foxbody could crush me.   The only legendary street racing car I know of is the beater bomb Foxbody which is exactly what I described, a  turbo LS Foxbody. It's put together extremely well it hooks very well. He takes down almost everything within its category."
tesla,Model S,3,"Tesla gets a bad rep for certain aspects of their build quality. However, where they lack physical quality, they make up for in software. The average Tesla owner isn't a petrol head and doesn't care about panel gaps, creaky plastic etc... They want a car that will get them from point A to B in a cheap and comfortable way."
bentley,,8,"Did a quick skim of the contenders, laptimes, and specs, and it's actually super impressive how many cars were able to keep up a good pace this year! If I may ask, a lot of these cars have previously made multiple appearances at previous LLs, and if they haven't, than their predecessors certainly have. What were some things you noticed in particular about certain models that separated them from their previous MYs or generations that you liked or disliked, whether it be suspension tuning, tire choice, aerodynamics, etc.  P.S. y'all are awesome at your work, I skim the website almost daily, reading the articles you guys put out."
tesla,Tesla,4,"A friend of mine was ridiculing electric vehicles and Tesla ten years ago when I told him this is the future, and that Tesla will be bigger than any automotive company in the world.   He is still ridiculing Tesla, and sends me articles like these, where ""aha! One Porsche model was sold more than one from Tesla!"".   I find it amazing how he keeps moving the goal, but in his mind he is still in the same argument with me. In only 10 years, we got to the point where it's fair comparison between a startup company and freaking Porsche, with Porsche even being seen as an underdog. And 10 years ago, ""Porsche selling more EVs than 911s in 2021"" was nothing but a bad joke."
porsche,911,7,"few thoughts on this article  * The 6 speed in the GT3 is one of the few truly great manual transmissions still out there. It is night-and-day different from the 7-speed manuals in the rest of the 911 lineup * Most manual transmissions are not great. The GT3 is one exception, the GT350 is another. Miata another good one.  * Examples of vague/poor manuals:  non-Shelby Mustangs, Camaros, Corvettes, BMWs, nearly every sports car out there.  * Why is this? Manuals are now an afterthought for vast majority of cars, it is only those few exceptions I mentioned above where the manual is the PRIMARY option for the car. In all other cases, performance and synergy with the rest of the powertrain is done with the automatic transmission in mind. * There are still some random economy cars out there that have great shifters - I call these happy accidents. Older Civics are a perfect example, I'm sure there are others (new Corolla?)."
lucid,Lucid,18,"But where would it go?   If Lucid raises prices from 100k -> 150k to clear the model s, it'll get owned even more than right now  if tesla lowers prices of the model s it'll cannibalize sales from the model 3, unless they also lower the model 3, which they can't do because their profits on the 3 aren't as good as other models. It's really the model y that's their moneymaker  I don't see a good solution for Lucid, tbh"
bentley,,3,"Not to mention, it's fucking scary and more dangerous than normal racetracks for all but the most experienced drivers. There are no guard rails on the switch backs, the roads are narrow with little shoulder, and immediately over the edge are *steep* drop offs. The smallest error that would be ""no big deal"" on a normal race track could easily result in death on Pikes Peak.   I'm not scared of heights. I pride myself on being a very competent and safe driver. But last summer I drove up Pike's Peak and once we got passed the treeline, my heart rate went up a bit and palms were sweaty. First time I'd ever felt that when driving."

bentley,Bentley,4,"James Bond helped a bit, but Aston is exactly as you put it, they're the perfect in-between. It's sporty enough, it's luxurious enough, and it's fancy enough, Bentley and Ferrari are way too much of what they're good at.   Ferrari is sporty and flashy, probably too sporty, and their dealers and SOME of their owners are too pretentious. Meanwhile, Bentley is luxurious and flashy it's a nice place to be in but it's not sporty enough for some...also people may think you sell some fine products.   Aston is the best of both and it's more low-key because weirdly enough, a lot of people have no idea what they are. So you also have a rarer vehicle because you may see multiple Ferraris or Bentleys in an area, but you might see 1 Aston. At least in my area that's how it is the areas are flooded with Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens, Range Rovers, Rolls-Royces, and Bentleys, it's to the point that they're just normal traffic and not special to see anymore, but every now and then an Aston pops up and you're like oh hello there pretty thing lol."
porsche,,5,"Skoda and VW seem to have way too much overlap, but at least they seem to have realized that Seat being in the same segment was taking things a bit too far and are now repositioning it as the affordable performance sub-brand (à la Pontiac) through the rebranding to Cupra"
rollsroyce,,3,"The Performance Model 3 I've rented a few months ago was an absolute blast to push in the twisities, besides the mind boggling acceleration. You do somewhat feel the weight of the car, but it's very precise, predictable and confidence inspiring. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it, and I've driven several high performance german sport cars before. I don't care about stereotypes or perceptions - it is a proper car enthusiast sedan, arguably the best at that price point.  The S P85+ I drove two years earlier was another story though, it really felt heavy and numb in tight corners, canyon carving really isn't its forte.  I also liked one pedal driving with the highest regen setting, it's quite relaxing once you get used to it. As other said, no seat issues here, I'm slightly under 6'.  I'll most likely go for a 4WD Model Y once my lease is over in 2022. I'd love a Performance one, but the premium is quite hard to justify for our daily when it's used on slow city streets ridden with potholes most of the time.  I will miss ventilated seats, Android auto and physical HVAC controls though."

tesla,Model S,3,"Fully loaded Model S refreshed Plaid is $146,490 USD plus local taxes and minus any incentives if you have them.   That is 21"" wheels, white interior.   FSD is 10k and not really necessary so I would say that actual cost is $136,490 plus taxes.     The Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo starts at $188,950 and can be speced out far higher then that.   Typical Porche you can customize just about everything.    But even that base car needs $300 option to add power folding side mirrors and many other small things.   You can easily price it up to well above 200k."
ferrari,,42,"I mean it's all perspective.  I had an RSX-S as my first 'grown-up car' that had 200hp at 2800lbs.  I felt like that was plenty quick, P/W of .071, essentially the same as a 1st gen 86/BRZ  Then I owned an S2000, so 240hp at 2800lbs.  P/W of .085, but no torque to speak of.  Now I'm in my Genesis with 311hp at 4000lbs, P/W of .077  If .071 was adequately quick, why wouldn't .077 be?  I think the Genesis has plenty of zip when I want to get on it, even if tossing 2 tons around in the corners seems like too much inertia for me.  I think it's more a factor of car guys chasing numbers and the pony cars having crazy high HP now comparatively.  You can still get in plenty of trouble with the power to weight ratio that sport compacts provide.  The frame of reference for people in the community has just shifted, but most normal people think 300hp still has plenty of zip in anything that's not an SUV."

Aside from the design language you mentioned  in the 90s, even modern IC vehicles have a grill separating the headlights. It's that constant reminder that air needs to pass through there to cool that ICE. You don't need that gap there for an EV. So they symbolize it with a continuous light bar.  At least that's how I imagine it anyway"
ferrari,,3,"That’s a good review. I’m loving mine and it’s actually really comfy on a road trip.   Biggest negative IMO is the fuel cutoff at redline, feels like you slammed on the brakes. Other than that I love it"
bentley,,3,"Another con you forgot to mention is poor cargo capacity and back seat room. It's been remarked about by almost everyone who reviews the G70 that the cargo capacity and back seat room are just not up to par compared to the rest of the class. For most everyday scenarios, they probably work just fine. But when you have 6'0""+ adults in the back, or you need to haul your whole family plus their suitcases to the airport - the G70 will be significantly worse at that task than a 3 series or A4."
bentley,,5,"The downvotes are probably because the platform is irrelevant. People pride themselves on knowing automotive trivia like this but that doesn’t make it matter. The implication of saying “tarted up” is that you are somehow getting swindled because fundamentally you’re buying something lower quality at a higher price but there is nothing about the MLB Evo platform that is unfitting of the vehicle. If you want to keep going you can say it shares a platform with the Audi A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 and their S and RS versions. Also the e-tron and Q5. There’s this weird misconception that vehicles on the same platform are identical under the skin. Also the vehicle was available only with the W12 at launch, the V8 is a newer option. This is the type of thing an auto journalist will pad a column with not something that is in any way relevant to owners."
porsche,Porsche,78,"Great writeup! As a fellow TM3P owner (a Minus, which it sounds like you also had if it shipped with MXM4s) who has also felt a love/hate relationship with the car, I'd like to address a few things, even though I'm sure this will be buried.  > Upon my departure of Tesland, I can't recall hearing of anyone replacing packs due to natural degradation. All the replacement stories I came across were pack failures in one form or another.  I'm a little confused by this. Your car was 15k miles into its 120k mile battery warranty. You don't mention any degradation you personally experienced, yet you cite it as a key reason for having sold the car. Why? Why not use up the battery warranty, and see how it fares in the meantime? WFIW, my car with 40k miles has degraded 10% already, most of it in the first 30k of ownership, with the last 10k being fairly flat. From what I read and see on Teslafi, this is the common experience. Makes me damn glad I went for the larger pack, but given I still have 80k of warranty left, it doesn't make me worried about the pack itself.  > So right off the batt (ha), you're 20% down if you're concerned for battery health.  You touched upon something I feel is not talked about nearly enough. Sometimes people on this forum look at rated range and go ""310 miles? That's nowhere near enough!"" Well, uh.... reality is actually way worse than that.  * You're not getting rated range on a road trip, at least with a Tesla. You're just not. Running at my preferred speed of 77 MPH, with AC low or off, on decent level ground, the mileage rating feels more like a kilometerage rating. I think the best I've reasonably done is around 220 miles, charging well into the 90% range and discharging well below 10%.  * But generally when you charge on a road trip, you're not charging to 90%+ because that would take way too long. Instead, you're charging from 5-70%, meaning only using 65% of the battery, or in my case 201 miles of rated range which is in reality around 154 miles. But that all probably doesn't even matter because:  * Range is charger-constrained, not battery-constrained. I recently drove from central TX to southern CA, which has a very defined Supercharger route-- essentially, you must stop at every Supercharger on the way no matter what size battery you have. Except this means chargers are spaced for the smallest 220-mile battery, and are therefore about 100-120 miles apart. So given you want to minimize charging time and don't want to charge above 70% or so, you're stopping every hour and a half no matter what. (And I presume if you have the smallest battery, you're forced to charge to 90%+ each time... oof.)  > since EVs are so efficient, every ""stressor"" they experience has a disproportionate impact on their range vs. a similar ICE vehicle.  Exactly. And that really adds up to a feeling of an overall fragile ecosystem-- everything only works because each component is perfectly efficient. But what if that's not the case? This point was driven home to me when I was driving south on I95 in Florida in gray weather. I was looking at the Supercharger map, and thinking ""I should be able to make it to Vero Beach no problem if I charge up enough; it's less than 200 miles away! And worst case, there's 4 other chargers on this route I could fall back to if needed."" So I charged above 90% and set off. Then it started raining. And raining. Pouring, even. I watched my rated range drop. And drop. ""Okay, I can't make Vero Beach, Palm Bay it is!"" Err, nope. ""Uh, okay, Titusville will do!"" Nope. Ultimately I pulled into the Daytona Beach charger with 20 miles of rated range left, having traveled just 84 miles. It really hammered home that efficiency is everything in an EV; take that away, and you realize just how little energy is truly contained in 2.2 gallons of gasoline. (Or more accurately, just how stupidly energy intensive moving 2 tons of metal with you at high speeds truly is.)  > At the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla.   I don't agree. If you can charge at home, and don't take too many road trips, virtually any EV (with the exception of those mid-100-mile range compliance EVs) is perfectly viable. And now that Tesla has seen fit to utterly destroy the infotainment system in a recent software update-- even /r/teslamotors is [up in arms](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rnz8tr/the_light_show_is_all_well_and_good_but_does/)-- I'm personally starting to consider those other EVs more than ever. The only downside is as an enthusiast, I've quite come to enjoy my mid-3s 0-60, and the only other EV that can do that in the ~60k range is the Mach E, which I'm kinda meh on overall. Here's hoping the EV6 GT actually comes out, and at a reasonable pricepoint-- or better yet, the Ioniq 5 introduces a GT variant, as that car is just stunning. Public charging is still an adventure with non-Tesla models, I will admit-- but if you either don't do that, or are willing to be an adventurer (I'm starting to fall in the latter category), it's perfectly doable. After all, consider the Porsche Taycan held the EV cannonball record for the majority of this year.  > When you go off the beaten path, that's when things get a little dicey. Every time we went somewhere a little ""unique,"" I'd have to carefully think about what type of range I could expect given the weather conditions and if it was realistic to make a round-trip without buggin'.  Yep. As I'll phrase it, ""I can go anywhere in this car... I just can't always get back."" There are large swaths of west TX I simply cannot feasibly travel. And check out the Supercharger route from Albuquerque NM to Wichita KS sometime.  I have also changed how I road trip-- if given the time, I used to use any road but highways. It's a much more scenic and interesting way to travel. Not so anymore, for obvious reasons. I expect this will improve over time as public fast chargers are added though.  > I genuinely feel like two years of driving this car has made me a dumber and less engaged driver.  I actually yelled ""YES!"" out loud when I read this part, heh. I don't know what it is. It's not like I've started getting into accidents or anything, but the Tesla absolutely seems to encourage dissociating the driver from the driving task in a way I've never felt with any of my other cars. Is it the coddling of technology and automation? Perhaps this is how it feels to drive a Camry? I'm really not sure.  > For most people, unfortunately, that's probably exactly what they want... but not me. I want to be involved. For most of my life, given the cars I've owned, the journey's always at least been some part of the reward.  After having sold my Mazdaspeed3 at the start of 2020, I hadn't driven stick again until a few months ago at the Houston Auto Show, where they miraculously had a manual STI available to drive at Subaru's ride-and-drive event. Even just driving that around the block at relatively tame speeds, I was quite excited and most definitely had the thought ""damn... I miss this."" (At the same time, I was still glad it wasn't me who had to pay to fuel and maintain it though....)  > And with the Tesla, I can't say that I ever really ""looked forward"" to driving it.  I have, but in a different way. I've always felt a sense of guilt about cars, as despite them being my #1 favorite hobby by far, it's an objectively awful one given the societal negative externalities. Driving an EV for me removes a lot of that guilt, which in turn allows me to simply enjoy driving more. I realize not everyone has that mental roadblock to begin with, but for me it really helped.  It also has allowed me to enjoy road trips in ways I never have before, though again, that's a very different form of ""looking foward to driving.""  > But I think all of their issues stem from dog-shit, stubborn management, rushing and not thinking things through carefully, an engineering-first approach, and Elon - a guy I can respect, but could use a serious ass-kicking once or twice.  Could not agree more.  > I remember coming across one topic where a guy with a Model X was wondering how he was going to take his family on a ski trip past a supercharger desert in the Northeast. They bought a bunch of 12V heated blankets to avoid running the heat. This is a $100K+ SUV we're talking about.  While I have not done anything quite so drastic, I fully admit I have modified my lifestyle in some small ways to accommodate the car, which some people would decry with ""if I have to modify my lifestyle in *any small way* this is completely unusable!! I will not stand for any inconvenience!!!"" But the fact is, you had to initially build your lifestyle in part around your chosen transportation method of choice anyways-- e.g. you would never have chosen to live in a car-dependent suburb with a garage if you hadn't also chosen to implode your finances with hundreds of dollars per month going towards a personal vehicle-- so having to make changes is really not a huge deal IMO. YMMV, but for me at least, the upsides of road tripping with an Autopilot-equipped EV outweigh the negatives.  [Continued...]"

I made my way to the car and a lady crawled out. She told me she swerved to miss a turtle LOL."
porsche,Porsche,28,"No, you don't need appointments. You need to report rude salesmen to Porsche. I walked in to both of my local Porsche dealers, showing up in a 10 year old civic, unannounced. I was offered test drives in caymans and 911s without asking at both places. Speaking with other people and from what I've read online my experience seems to be closer to the norm than the bad experiences people have had with Porsche. Appointments obviously make things easier and you might not have to wait when you get there but they aren't mandatory."
bentley,,6,"> Porsche just like Mercedes since 2009-2011 roughly has stepped it up significantly and even before while they had some known failures the majority have always been reliable and capable of 200k+ easy.  It's not repairs that are the major worry (while they do tend to be more expensive, Porsche's sports cars tend to be extremely reliable/durable, you're right there). When comparing to a car like a Veloster, regular maintenance is more, probably noticeably more.  Tires cost more due to bigger wheels and/or smaller sidewalls. If the owner sticks with near-OEM levels of grip, they also wear out faster (and might cost even more... or might not). Tire cost will almost certainly be higher.  Brake parts tend to cost more.  Oil changes use more oil (Porsche's boxer motors use lots of oil - IIRC our GT3 wants over 8 quarts). It's also often a specific weight that, while common here, can be harder to find in places where sporty cars are less common. Other fluid changes tend to be particular about the fluids, as well.  If we're comparing to a Corvette, maintenance costs are extremely similar (nearly identical). But the maintenance costs on a Porsche will be noticeably more than on a Veloster."
porsche,Porsche,6,"Yep! Have a few nifty cars, along with 2 Porsches currently, in the garage. So, I'm familiar with any possible issues on them. I know PDK is the biggest tho I haven't had anything like that happen.   Huracan has had no issues so far. It's been more reliable than my R8 somehow even though they're almost the same car. My R8 has had pesky AC issues, which is more expensive than you think to fix. $2.5k I think it was. Plus another time it failed.   My Jaguar F type R on the other hand, has been a pain in the ass. It's in the shop getting a new engine right now. Now that's a big ticket fix. British cars amirite."
lucid,,4,"I'm sorry but there is no way that that is average unless you're in an extremely specific area/environment. Out of a thousand 3500s, how many are modified so heavily that they go from high 8s 0-60 to low 5s?  In practice, almost no cars on the road weigh even close to 9000lbs and just as few accelerate as abruptly as an eHummer.  edit : I'm going to assume that lift kits and giant wheels don't exactly improve the manufacturer's baseline (and already fairly slow) 0-60 either."
porsche,911,12,"I don't give a flying fuck about those kind of cars, and I actually dislike a lot of them they need to be extremely aerodynamic and tend to be too flat/low for my taste.

I don't care about Android Auto (and my understanding is that the main issue left is validation/certification and it'll be out ""Soon""), I use CarPlay, so that's whatever for me. If the built-in nav was better (i.e. Google Maps) I would probably never use phone mirroring at all.  I don't have any of the key troubles a lot of folk seem to report, it works great for me actually, but I park in a below-ground garage, so the car is out of range of the phone/fob until I get down there.  I will say I'm getting better efficiency in the New England winter than he did in the Midwest winter, just about 3.0 mi/kWh. The penalty of the different wheels+tires is pretty steep (I think it's most of a 10% EPA-estimated range hit to go from the base 19-inch wheels and all-seasons to 20s and summer tires; winter tires are also probably worse), on top of the dual-motor setup and higher power output of the GT over the Pure.

I would inspect everything to make sure it matches. Ferrari of yore was famous for putting in wrong trim from what was ordered. I am sure its not the same now but you should make sure everything is perfect and the paint is perfect. Make sure to take it outside and look it over in the sun.  Also keep the revs down. They supposedly need a break in period and you shouldn't redline or even go over 5-6k rpm for the first couple thousand miles.
lucid,,22,"I am perfectly okay with what Volkswagen did re: Dieselgate. In fact, I'm bordering on glad they did it, and I'm sad they got caught. The punishment was also disproportionately high compared to the Harley Davidson and other various emissions scandals during the period. VW delivered a superior product to their customers with unnoticeable harm done to the environment. The ""fixed"" cars had worse fuel economy, worse performance, and the emissions components have a higher failure rate now thanks to the increased duty cycles. The United States (and CARB specifically) are getting a little too strict with emissions standards, there's a study I can link that shows that smog in the LA basin bottomed out about 5-10 years ago. We're hitting diminishing returns with regards to pollution control. We need to stop tightening this crap unnecessarily and let technology catch up."
tesla,,8,"> In reality they’d be able to sell at X - dealership profit, since the store operation itself would not be for profit.   Last I checked the manufacturer is a business, not a charity. There is no way they would tie up billions in dealerships and staff, just to break even. They are not a benevolent entity looking out for the little guy.  >The dealership model is a lose lose situation for both automakers and consumers, the only party benefiting from it is the dealership.  The only way automakers could be induced to providing end distribution is the opportunity to make more money. Even prior to covid they had a cozy arrangement where they sold cars by the hundreds and thousands to dealers who paid up immediately and didn't quibble about options, etc. If the car sat for months on the dealer's lot, it wasn't their problem - they'd been paid for it already.   This leaves them handling not only individual customers, their trades, but multiple regional financial institutions, country, state, provincial permits, laws, and DMV procedures."
bentley,,3,"its odd that someone would be taking turns reckless enough to need an extra second or two of accel in that instance.   my point is, none of them can be widely considered as  having true widespread real world utility.   0-60 is a measurement. a standard. it’s a standard that when comparing multiple cars of similar variables (forced induction, drivetrain, tire) you can tell which car is quicker. i dont think any knowledgable person is saying it’s a one trick pony, but if you combine 0-60, 1/4 mile et and trap, and take into account those variables, then you should have a solid picture of the cars acceleration.   those numbers and getting into the specifics of those numbers should only really matter to people who actually plan on mashing the throttle from a dig and roll, rather than people saying “because i dont do it it’s useless”."

When CEOs and much of management changed in 2020, they saw what was going on and cancelled it. In turn they basically gave Jaguar the time and freedom to make what they want while contracting Magnr-Steyr to engineer the new platform and such   While it makes sense now, A LOT of money was wasted on a fully completed car, and could've at least helped get Jaguar through this current dip they have with no cars in their line up"

You can land those at any local field of which there are tons.  Besides being safer than helicopters they can fly in all conditions, they’re faster, have way more range, are more comfortable, cheaper to operate and your pilots can be type certified for all your aircraft and you don’t need a dedicated helicopter pilot."
lucid,Lucid,9,">Sure in pure acceleration the tesla is a smudge ahead but in the real world the lucid makes far more sense. Battery efficiency and range are in another class compared to the Model S  As many of our Mach-E friends have learned, Range alone isn't always enough if the charging network available to you sucks. Not to mention that Tesla took years to build up a service network that isn't painful for owners. Lucid has to start at square one.  Those two things can really hurt real-world usability.   When Tesla was new many people stayed away because buying a car from the new guy in town comes with its own set of challenges compared to buying a car from established players. But now, Tesla is that established player, and Lucid is the new kid.    Besides, 9.25 @152.6 mph is a bit more than a smudge ahead of 9.91 @ 144.40 mph. Not that it matters in daily driving though."

bentley,,8,"* Reliability (track record). The 2019 was the 6th iteration of the 3rd gen IS, so all the major kinks should have been worked out. The 2GR engine has proven itself to be bulletproof, and is known to be overbuilt / understressed. The AWD system is a geared center differential with a clutch pack, so it's achieving R70% / F30% power distribution through gearing alone. The 6 speed auto (A760H) is similarly bulletproof.  * AWD system has virtually no issues with wearing out or breaking down or any of that nonsense, it's a proven system that Lexus uses and it's one of the last old school types with a geared center differential and a clutch pack to modulate the power up to 50/50. It is an excellent system, as proven by the last winter we had here in SW Ontario.  * Transmission / transfer case is fully serviceable (I've been told the transfer case shares the same oil as the transmission in the GS/IS/RC).  * Fast enough. I tested this out in Sport S+ mode (automatic, automatic with paddles, manual shift only) and it's already more than enough power for the street. It does take a little bit to get going and overcome inertia, but the car comes alive after 3000rpm and the V6 sounds sweet. I miss the rush of torque that turbos give, but I do like that it builds power all the way to redline and I adore the instant throttle response. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want more power though. If the IS500 arrives with a V8 (unlikely) or a TTV6 **and** RWD/AWD, I'll be trading it in.  * Price was reasonable after discounts, dealership experience was better than Genesis (although I would not have let a slightly bad experience stop me from getting the car I want).  This is not to say that the G70 or Stinger GT sucks, because I came very close to getting the Stinger GT. I believe that Genesis brought their A+ game when it came to designing a 3 series fighter, which is no surprise because the direction is basically coming from all the Germans poached from BMW and Audi."
tesla,Tesla,18,"The problem that we are seeing is that ditching the dealership model for Tesla means better sales, but far worse service. They have little incentive to expand how many service centers they have so there is a constant backlog. What we are seeing is that non dealership models drastically reduce brand loyalty, so it's highly unlikely that companies selling work vehicles like Ford, Dodge, GM and Toyota would switch. It might make sense for more luxury companies, but their dealership experience is much better and is usually apart of the appeal so I am not sure it would make sense there either. I would love for less dealer mark up, but I am not so sure the model is going anywhere anytime soon."

tesla,,13,">The divergence is when people start acting like the Chinese auto industry is technologically superior to its rivals. They’re not. That is absolutely ridiculous.   Repeating myself here: I was just in China a few months ago. I've been in all of these cars, including flagships like the [Stelato S9](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinacars/s/uUzgRARkQO). I'm telling you very straightforwardly, as gently as I can, person-to-person: You have your head in the sand on this issue. You do not know what you're talking about. I do, because I have *literally been in all of these cars.*   When you've actually gotten your hands on the likes of the Zeekr 009, Li L9, and Aito M9, you are welcome to come back to me and we can have an adult exchange about their merits, because we will then both be on even footing. We can talk about the wild second-row tech on the 009, because we'll have both experienced it. We can talk about infotainment on the Li L9, because we'll have both experienced it. We can talk about the fit and finish on the M9, because we'll have both experienced it.   Until then, I have been in all of those cars and you haven't. This conversation is the allegory of [Plato's Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave), and you're agitatedly explaining your theories on shadows to someone from the outside world.   This ain't it, bud."

lucid,,14,"> My problem with auto AC is the temperature I want the car at changes. I’m not one of those set it and forget it people. I get hot or cold during a drive and need to change the temperature. Or get sick of the vents blowing on my arms and change it to only use the lower vents. Or don’t want the air blowing as high as the auto setting has it, so turn it down.   duuuude i always wonder about newer cars and how people can stand the auto a/c stuff. i guess i'm just used to old school controls because i'm the same as you, always changing it up. that's how i like it."

lucid,,9,"Lots of people already commented stating such, but no ones provided a source to back up their claims RE: environmental regulations impacting paint:  https://www.thedrive.com/news/2023-nissan-z-production-lags-far-behind-due-to-paint-problems-report  > The problems are said by Driver Web to stem from **issues at Nissan's plant in Tochigi** where the Z is built. Subject of the Nissan Intelligent Factory initiative, Tochigi has an **increased emphasis on sustainability** and the latest production technologies, including increased automation. Both of these have been implemented in **the painting process, and it's where the Z's bottleneck is said to lie.**"
