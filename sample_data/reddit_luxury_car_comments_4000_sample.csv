Almost like the car version of old money fits and all that.       Add on your standard clientele of nyc finance bros and men in mid-life crisis and you get absurd demand. You go to any meetup or auto show and the 911s, particularly GT cars, are displayed alongside the exotics. Absurd the money these are going for new and used."

If you really want to get technical, the powerplant of the vehicle is a Rolls Royce produced engine, just not one for cars.  They could have embraced this and used it as free marketing. It wasn't hurting their brand in any feasible way. Instead they spent money to sue this person, got no payment in return and made themselves look like massive cunts for no reason."

Automakers have spent a century marketing performance and the superior performance of EVs was expected to easily win out. They underestimated I think how hard it is to convince people to adopt something so radically new and different (plus sports car owners really like the ruble and vroom aspects). They've also all struggled with getting EV pricing where it needs to be to really drive adoption. It seems only so many people are willing to spend a significant premium for an EV, no matter how fast the 0-60 time is or how quick it laps nuremberg or climbs pikes peak."

It kinda sucked.   But I have to give Matt Farah credit. Despite growing up in a wealthy household, the guy clearly busts his ass and has done so for years (decades).

I've had the enormous privilege of driving both a F1 599 *and* a gated manual 599. Driving those two back to back really illustrates why the gated box has gone the way of the dodo for the Scuderia.  That 15ish year old car was too fast for a gated box. It's *so* quick, it gains and drops revs *so* quickly, and anyone who's ever driven a real gated car will tell you, that style of gearbox can't be hustled like that consistently. You have to be so brutal with it that it feels wrong.  ...and the cars have only gotten faster since."

Even the Meriden wasn't particularly impressive even on the previous gen but whoever designed the in-house system should be fired and somehow they've somehow made it worse.  Better through software updates but its almost unacceptable at the base MSRP much less at 125k+. Asked the rep and they said it improves environmental impact due to lower weight and fewer precious metals. What? On a 7000lbs+ EV SUV thats an argument?

It’s been better than any fca car I’ve rented in the last 5 years. The interior is better then infinities I test drove a couple years ago.    The byd ventilated seats are really comfortable. The ride is smooth and quite. Charging is fast. No weird obvious build issues. Uniform body panel gaps.   I have no clue the long term reliability of them. I have no clue the factory support or open recalls. It was the car that was randomly assigned and ive been extremely pleasantly surprised. Wanted to share my experiences with other auto enthusiasts.

Likely high on cost because the shop is dedicated to the brand and has to keep the lights on out there in Santa Clara.   It’s not the same as going to a dealership, you’re going to a shop that likely works on a single car at a time or a couple cars. Where the overhead is wildly insane and there isn’t likely to be a lot of volume.   When you sign up to own a rare and expensive car, you sign up for a rare and expensive mechanic shop."

I'm not shocked they can put together a quality car.   The goalpost of being able put together a quality car is not what's being described here. We're way past that — that's the foundational thing you're missing here, and what I'm now repeatedly emphasizing to you after Reuters has attempted to do so. This is not about putting together a quality car — it is an entirely different discussion with a much larger scope. This is the touch-down on decades of policy focused on advanced manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication expertise, energy infrastructure, and so much more.   You've got a lot of of reading, listening, and watching to do before you're even equipped for this conversation. For some easy picks, I'd suggest Wired Magazine's [Shenzhen: The Silicon Valley of Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY) (a bit old, but very very good) as a primer, as well as *Apple in China* by FT's Patrick McGee. There's a great old episode about [the semiconductor supply chain](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-global-chip-shortage/id1011668648?i=1000533850745) with Harvard's Willy Shih on Decoder, and a more recent one on Dwarkesh with [Asianometry's Jon Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3KKUKXcTM). I think maybe top it off with [this interview](https://pca.st/jn3h4ej0) about industrial policy with Princeton's Kyle Chan and maybe we can have a sort of sensible discussion.  This is where the Plato's Cave analogy comes in — until you understand how far this rabbit hole goes and how large the scope the topic is it's not going to click for you."

Instead you could push people to buy the more expensive variant/brand if they wanted a stronger engine or better interior, etc.   You have to remember that a company's main purpose is to make as much money as possible while spending as little as possible, not to put V8s in minivans so that people don't buy 200k super SUVs anymore. They're not a charity trying to provide you the best product for your money.  Also, both the RSQ8 *and* the Cayenne Turbo GT were ""nerfed"" because they want you to buy the Urus for 50-100% more if you want the best of everything. The Turbo GT's 0-60 time officially is conveniently 0.1s slower than the Urus on the spec sheet even though it beats the Urus 9/10 times in the real world, even in the 1/4 mile.

FWIW I'll only buy a new car when an EV I want (and can afford) hits the market, so I'm watching this segment eagerly to see what comes down the pipeline. The Spectre is exquisite but way out of my price range, the Maserati Granturismo is pretty but falls short on some fairly simple things like seat comfort and screen responsiveness. The Cayman and Boxster will be two seaters and my dog wouldn't like being strapped to the roof. And that's it for the segment.

It's also a rare production car (particularly for a luxury sedan) that can lap at 10/10ths for an entire tank of fuel (about eight glorious laps at VIR) with zero degradation in brakes. The tires fall off a couple seconds, but then hold steady there."

I have an MG ZS EV, which was the cheapest EV available in Australia when I got it two years ago, and it's based on a cheap small SUV.  Fit is pretty good, but materials are pretty cheap and there's fairly obvious cost cutting going on...  ...but it rides well, and that combined with the silence makes it surprisingly comfortable and soothing to be in.  We had an S205 C-Class estate and much as I loved that thing, I'd actually rate the MG as being more comfortable (looking at you, 19 inch Pirelli run-flats).  If you put quiet, good ride and a smart selection of quality materials put in the right places together, you're a long way down the road to a ""luxury experience"""

I’ve been following this closely because my company has to ship cars all the time and all over the world.   We always recommend large companies: Reliable, Horseless Carriage, Intercity. We have seen far too much shady shit with independent small transporters. But they are cheap and they can often do timelines the big boys can’t meet. If a car needs to be in Seattle four days from now, it’s likely an independent with a two car hauler and a Dodge 2500 diesel.   The way these things usually go is the buyer arranges transport and because they don’t do this often and they’re looking for cheap and fast, they put out a bid (or contact a shipping broker) that gets circulated on a couple of clearing houses for this kind of thing. The independent shipper scrolls through a bunch of bids until they find one that’s going where they want and will pay a rate they like. They accept it, show up, and transport the car.   What the scammer does is look for the car they want. They accept the bid. After they get the bid, they relist it on the same site.  This isn’t unheard of, some companies make their money trading bids like day traders do stocks. Only this time they list it at a really good price so a very reputable shipper will take it and deliver it quickly. When that shipper takes it, they get a contact with a different drop off location.   Now that car is on the express to California (and ultimately Mexico) while you’re expecting to see your car sometime next week. By the time you realize your car isn’t going to be delivered, it’s already in Mexico in the hands of the cartel.   When you try to track down the original company you consulted with, you find they are a former good company that  stopped operations and someone bought the name and business documents. It’s just a shell and impossible to tell who actually owns it or runs it.    It leaves the owner in a really bad spot.  The dealership isn’t really liable though they should have double checked the destination address (we now double check the address every time and it’s a fireable offense if you don’t).  The company who delivered the car isn’t liable, they had a valid contract  and picked up and delivered exactly when and where they were told.  The company at fault isn’t findable or sueable.  The authorities in Mexico don’t want to get involved. The buyer’s insurance may not pay out because they never actually took delivery of the car.    It’s a mess. Granted, the new “owner” won’t be able to have the car serviced at an official dealership and the car can’t leave the country, but if you can drive a Ferrari around for the price of a Corvette, that might be ok for you."

My Elantra N is a 6-speed manual one with no sunroof (US-spec car) so I’ll be commenting based on that.   It’s a ton of fun. It’s freaking fast (not just “for 276hp”, but in general, it’s quite a bit faster than you’re expecting it to be, especially when going 40+mph), it corners incredibly well, the chassis and steering are reasonably responsive, the interior is solid and it’s quite striking in person. I’ve driven mine from Alabama to Wisconsin and back and I never gave comfort a second thought; just throw it in Eco, turn cruise control and lane keep assist on, then just chill out. The seats are surprisingly comfortable for long trips, moreso than my boyfriend’s Mazda CX-50.   My main gripe is that fuel economy is terrible on the stock tires and with the 6-speed manual. You’ll be lucky to get anything over the EPA estimations unless the weather is absolutely perfect.

Here's the quote: ""A 2018 WRX with the Performance package was only a tenth quicker than the new car despite having upgrades this year's WRX could have put to good use: track-worthy high-performance brake pads...""  Of course, the tS I drove this year had more than just better pads, but an entire Brembo brake package. And that's what made them fade-free. (2) It's impossible to know if different tires—let alone which ones—would reduce the WRX tS's massive understeer. But a switch of rubber could also make it worse. And the only way to find out would be to try several sets, a very expensive proposition. And a tire change could also make the transient response feel twitchy or disconnected front-to-rear in a way that would upset the driver's confidence and the car's consistency. I didn't try the softer suspension settings, as the Subaru engineers on hand said that sport+ would yield the quickest lap times, and they have a lot more experience with the car than me.  I never got the sense that the car was riding too stiff; we ride a lot of the curbs at VIR as it's the fastest way around, and the sT soaked them all up quite well."

ferrari,Ferrari,cars,1lt406x,n1no4zp,2025-07-06T16:25:27,woodsides,160,"A friend of mine decided to do this in the US a few years ago. He basically went to the local dealer and said that he wanted to get offered the then unreleased LaF successor. The dealer basically laid out a multi year game plan and guided him through it. At that point he only had a 812 GTS, 488 pista and a GTC4Lusso. He started of by ordering all the new cars on offer, SF90 coupe and spider, Roma coupe and spider and later 296 coupe and spider and and Purosangue. Specced all of them very heavily, Tailor made and Atelier whenever possible. Gradually sold off the cars he didn't want back to the dealer for a massive loss (market crashed on hybrids).  Next, he acquired a F40, LaFerrari and 458 Speciale Aperta from the dealer in one year. The next year, he got a F50 and  Monza SP2 and a 812 Competizione Aperta (resale for $1.4M over MSRP) a year later. Last year, he bought a Daytona SP3 ($3.6M over MSRP).  Apart from this, he went to all the Ferrari events his dealer invited him to, Pebble beach, F1, etc. He finally achieved his goal and got the allocation for F80 last year. He also did the Classiche certification program for all his classics.   This probably could be done for cheaper but it would take longer. This process usually takes 6-7 years but he made it in under 4, but had to pay a price. So yeah, $40-50M for a Fastrack or $20-25M if you're more dedicated and have the time and energy to go racing in XX and challenge cars. You obviously don't have to go as balls out as he did. Racing challenge is the easiest path tbh. Gets you there in 3-4 years without too much money (~10-15M). To be honest, it's not really worth it if all you want is one car. Just pay the market premium and be done with it. But if you want to have access to all the new cars and want to be a part of the joint experience, it's worth it. All the cars will hold value and appreciate decently but most owners like him aren't in it for the gains (obviously terrible compared to elsewhere). They've got their businesses for that. It's the cars, the collections, the stories and the people they get to meet through these experiences that matter at this level.   Ferrari have a tier list for all the customers that have ever interacted with their brand. There's 5 tiers and the highest one is literally called TOP. This consists of the top ~500 customers around the world and are usually the folk who get the hypercars. You've gotta crack into that tier for which the requirements get higher every year. All the things that you do, buying cars, speccing them with a lot of options and customizations, attending events, servicing and restoring cars at dealer, selling back cars to dealer, attending events, participating and sponsoring their racing programs, they all count towards points that determine your ranking on the list. Remember, there's a lot of centi-millionaires and billionaires out there but only 500 cars to give out."

This applies to all* cars when you replace whatever module stores the odometer value. You have to transfer the old value over to the new module manually.  Maybe bit ironically it is the same reprogramming tools that are intended to enter old odometer value into a new module that also get used to do odometer fraud and can be easily be found for most brands.  *Some cars store a odometer backup value in more than one place, i.e. instrumental cluster and ecu, though I'm not aware of any that it restoring automatically.

Auto journalists are actually ahead here; their praise of BMW iDrive 9 and UConnect, plus critiques of Lexus, Acura, Nissan, and Hyundai/Kia EV planning align with my experience road-tripping Ariya, Ioniq, and Wagoneer.  >**2) Fixation on sportiness**   Reviewers unnecessarily compare practical cars like minivans against performance cars, misrepresenting comfort-focused priorities.  * **Performance Requirements:** Most buyers are city-adjacent, needing responsive vehicles for dense traffic and mountain trips. Vehicles like Telluride/Sienna add stress due to weak dynamics. * **Tradeoffs:** IMO mainstream cars shouldn’t sacrifice practicality like Mazda's inline-6 and slow steering versus Jeep’s simpler, more effective setups (Pentastar/2.0T with ZF8). Mazda really fucked their budget here by let the engineers do whatever they want. * **Customer Expectation:** Lighter steering, quiet performance, capable handling are all asks from customers to help with parking, to allow them to rip it without waking the kids, and to make road tripping 7-8 hours across WA/CA/CO mountain passes a breeze.    * BMW planners probably laugh everytime someone complains about steering feel, fake exhaust noise and air suspension/active sway bars. They're absolutely capable of engineering what enthusiasts are asking for but they're more of a vocal minority that don't even buy brand new BMWs.  >**3) Visibility**   Proper mirror adjustment should eliminate blind spots, so reviewers shouldn't overly focus on them.  I've daily-driven Abarth, S2000, and GR86 with the proposed mirror setup. It creates poor visibility during city parking, directly impacting livability for urban buyers with high disposable income.  Our job isn't to be technically correct/impose our POV, our job is to create a product that supports the buyer expectation and typical journey. The last time someone tried this (Saab, Fisker), they went bankrupt.  >**4) Physical Controls**   Reviewers excessively praise large screens when critical controls should remain physical.  Though some systems (VW, Subaru dual-screen, BMW iDrive 8) are bad, clear screen labels generally help casual drivers. Journalists already effectively highlight poor screen designs.  >**5) Configurable Instrument Panels**   Reviewers’ fixation on navigation displays in instrument clusters instead of central screens seems unnecessary.  However, configurable panels (Google Maps, HUDs) significantly enhance usability ... again think high disposable income buyer in LA/NY/SF who has to navigate really shitty street grids and cut across 7 lanes of traffic while watching the map. Hyundai's blind spot cameras here are genius.  Personally, Toyota’s lack of configurability and poor nighttime dimming of PRNDL and turn signals are papercuts that 100% cause customer dissatisfaction and complaints  >**6) Failure to discuss actual livability**   Reviewers should prioritize daily usability: phone connectivity, intuitive controls, and vehicle effectiveness.  Auto journalists already do this well. Alex on Autos offers practical specs, SavageGeese evaluates vehicle intent thoughtfully, and enthusiast outlets (Road and Track, Car and Driver) cover urban-friendly performance clearly."
