tesla,Model S,1,they had the first mover advantage. they re going to stay with a reduced but still really good market share in the same way netflix is doing right now. they re here to stay
lucid,,4,"by that logic manufacturers are also over engineering ice cars. new features are being added to ice cars too, and this has been happening since the 1880s. in any case, it is not something to worry about too much since soon most car manufacturers will be making evs and before long most cars on the road will likely be evs. here is another point of view that might you see evs in a different light according to bp, one of the largest oil companies in the world, earth has about 50 years worth of known fossil fuels at current usage levels. if we use it all up, we will have none left in case of a civilisational collapse that requires access to cheap and rugged energy that we might need to reboot civilisation. keep in mind that that is for current usage levels, which are without doubt going to increase. also keep in mind that we have no marketable solution for alternative power sources in airplanes, and that we will probably still want military vehicles to run on liquid fuel that is independent of a grid. we really cannot afford to burn fossil fuels in cars if there is an alternative, which there is. evs will also lessen dependency on foreign oil imports, which in a world with mounting international tension, is a huge guarantor of safety and independence for countries who can generate their own electricity. relying on fossil fuels is a matter of national security for most western nations, although this is rarely discussed in favour of the environmental arguments."

ferrari,,3,"it s a real f40 lol, the starting bid is 2.555m, with a buy it now of 5m"
tesla,Model S,1,the products are. the ability to sell them to idiots is top notch. i salute apple.
lucid,,7,"there are too many hipster enthusiasts who think a shit tier interior with shit tier nvh, along with shit tier suspension, equals engaging. slow car fast is rarely more fun than fast car slow. that s just something guys with slow cars tell themselves to feel better about their purchase. in no way is a miata more fun than a c7 at any speed. tying both of those together, just because your shitbox sounds like it s breaking the sound barrier at 60, does not make it feel like doing 120 in a more capable car. and it certainly doesn t make the shitbox more fun."
tesla,Model S,7,"it does not, which is one of the complaints i ve seen in reviews comparing it s noise generator thingy to the ioniq 5n."
ferrari,Ferrari,24,"now that ev s have democratized speed and our appliance pods getting us around will all be electric, and speed is no longer special, i wonder how these hypercar oem s like ferrari are going to continue differentiating. will it always be with a combustion engine? i m thinking decade s out. do you think they will get special carveouts for engines? etc, etc."
porsche,,3,"based on my experience in canada, mercedes service is excellent. it s costly, but it s excellent. they also fuck up with some frequency but they go out of their way to satisfy you afterward. i had symptoms of a serious issue crop up within a week of purchase on a certified pre owned amg. the car had been displaying symptoms of the issue with its prior owner and mb had done two minor fixes to attempt to resolve the problem. when i brought it in they reviewed the history, decided to escalate the issue and investigate more carefully. turned out that they needed to replace the head gaskets and all the head bolts, which they did under warranty. they could have easily done the bare minimum, deferred the problem over and over until the warranty expired and left me to pay for an expensive and profitable fix out of pocket but they made intelligent decisions based on the car s service history, pre empted the critical issue and fixed it at no cost to me."
rollsroyce,,22,"i ve heard that before and i think i can remember mike brewer mentioning it on wheeler dealers once but, it was a long time ago back when they used to sell an engine and frame which you then had to take to a separate coach builders that they just gave the adequate number. my dad had a silver shadow for a while and kept saying the same thing till i pointed out in the documentation that came with the car that it was 172hp."
ferrari,,20,"there is also a jet beetle and a long time ago i bought a truck from some guy, but before that he took me around back and showed off an old 80 s or 90 s full sized van he shoved a giant jet engine into. it was so large, that he had maybe 2 of space on the left of the jet to sit and steer. i shoulda taken some pics. apparently it was stupid fast at the time, but sadly he was seriously injured in a different race event and could not longer drive it. he called it the jet van but i can t find it on google."
ferrari,Ferrari,13,"a race car such as the ferrari f2004 would outperform the hennessey on every performance metric, aside from top speed the most worthless of metrics . lmfao"
bentley,,12,"there have always been disposable cars on the market. the dart, fairlane, impala, beetle, etc come to mind. some of them sold in the millions before model changes. modern cars are lucky to break 200k between model changes. my grandpa bought a new car every year, partly because he could afford to, but also because the cars back then were always changing. car manufacturers in the 50s and 60 refreshed or redesigned cars on a yearly basis in most cases to avoid the cars looking dated, as styling was constantly evolving at that point. currently we have designs that stick around for up to 5 years, sometimes longer. the current c6 corvette came about in 2005 and the styling is identical other than the addition of the z06 and zr1 models. in the early days the corvette had annual styling changes. it s not the only modern car in that situation. saying the current designs won t be remembered fondly or won t be timeless is simply opinion. back in the 80 s everything was a box on wheels, but as those cars are getting into their 30 s, they have started finding new enthusiasts and collectors. the same will happen, and already has in some cases, to the cars from the 90s, the 2000s will be no different. the kids that are growing up and seeing the cars of today in 30 years will look back at what their parents drove and likely see them as collectible. cars with limited runs, like the acr srt 4s, despite being hopped up neons, will be a rarity, much like the hemi powered mopars have become. collectible cars like old mustangs from the 60s vastly outsold their modern counterparts, meaning down the road a modern boss mustang might be worth considerably more for it s time than the originals were. on a side note, people these days actually keep their cars much longer than they ever used to do a quick search on that , because cars today are much better engineered than old cars, are vastly more reliable, and last much longer than they used to. 100k miles on a car from the 50s with no major overhaul would have been a miracle."
rollsroyce,,31,yeah i am considering buying an old civic or something as a commuter but i don t have the room for 3 cars and can t bring myself to sell the camaro just yet. it s a low mile one owner. also buying a third car just to go to the airport seems a little impractical at the moment. might just have to get the so acquainted with the next one so i can take her car to the airport. then i ll only be nervous of curb rash at least.
porsche,,5,"my friend and i found local lease agreements for base nissan leafs that others had shared online forums focus on finding the best deals . we emailed the agreements to several dealerships and asked them to give us the same. most tried to hassle us to come in and test drive, etc. but we made it clear we weren t visiting their showroom unless they sent a signed lease agreement in advance. one salesman finally relented and made two sales. after incentives i leased a new leaf for two years for 40 month. god i hated that car."
porsche,Porsche,8,"sometimes, people do things because they re good people who enjoy what they do. i would expect the sort of folks who are lucky enough to work in wec for a living are probably the sort who are grateful for that opportunity, and feel genuine camaraderie toward their opponents. but folks here who like to believe that s possible that this is actually a nice, heartfelt message from one storied brand to another, regardless of their current ownership are just naive, right? tell me, marketing man, who is this commercial aimed towards, exactly? who do you feel watches wec, or has any idea about what s being conveyed here would actually suddenly see this video and think fuck, i know, i want a porsche now! ..? nobody. the answer is nobody. this video, like the one before it, convinces no one to buy a luxury sports car. it s made for its own sake, not for the purpose of marketing to a segment of some of the most wealthy, and automotive savvy people on the planet. you should consider a xanax."
lucid,,3,
bentley,,3,"i m in the valve drop is an overblown issue crowd. i don t know anyone personally that it s happened to, but i do know a couple of friends of friends that have had issues. they made a lot of these motors and the ones that have had problems are considerably more vocal than those out enjoying the car. i believe gm initially called it a small batch problem with the early cars but that might have just been pr from them. i bought the car with aftermarket heads already on it so idk how many miles on them for sure but i ve put about 30k miles on the car the last 5 years largely issue free. went down last month due to some leaks in the rear end, but thats the only issue i ve had since i ve had it and i m not exactly gentle with it i don t abuse it, but it s definitely getting driven when i take it out . if you plan to boost the car at all i would go gs over z06, the ls3 takes boost much better"
porsche,,27,"i think it was in a petrolicious video on a classic ferrari where the owner said something that really resonated with me in the end, it doesn t really matter what it s worth if i never sell it. i don t have a very good track record of selling cars, and i feel like i would deeply regret getting rid of it with the story it has. i ve poured time and money into much less valuable cars for many years now with no regrets!"
lucid,,5,"context. drag at 30mph is negligible for a passenger car, relative to other losses. rolling resistance is vastly greater than drag, for a typical car, at 30mph. that flips around at some point between 40mph and 50mph for most cars."
ferrari,,3,"the worst part is the c7 tail lights, imo, were perfect. i describe the c8 ones as bastardized camaro lights as well lol. someone should just photoshop swap the rear bumper area of a c7 onto the c8. one of the parts that bugs me the most about the c8 rear is how the center section of the rear sticks out farther than the edges and then runs angular forward to the rear tires which is why the rear wing is ugly too, those angular turns to the ends . the vettes have had a mostly flat and swoopy smooth rear end forever. it s little things like that which get to me, but i think in a few years they ll make some adjustments and i ll love it"
rollsroyce,,17,"yeah, small hidden sensors were where my mind went too. crash sensors, daylight sensors, temp sensors, buckle switches, occupancy detection in seats, wheel speed sensors, ride height sensors, o2 sensors. luxury might have more of some of these, but a lot of them will be the same part."
tesla,Model S,17,a lot of redditors hate tesla because of their ceo but whether they want to admit it or not they engineer a fantastic vehicle. they have the best ev tech as of right now and with each year they are making a better car around it and getting their qc cleaned up as well. i understand that someone might not buy one because of musk but i love mine and it is truly an engineering marvel in my opinion.
ferrari,,6,
rollsroyce,,9,"last year, i had the scrub privilege of sitting in one on the motor show floor although i did have a handful of backseat time in older alphard vellfire vans . it might not have been as flashy as the chinese cars nearby, but even special is underselling it. the lm was cavernous inside. i didn t recall many complaints about the interior either. it was hard to grasp how all that space was intended for four people until you get in, shut the door and start fooling around with the lounge seat controls. that wide screen also made the car feel like it s a brand new 15 year old car, even while it was turned off. i guess some things stay the same with lexus"
bentley,,64,the lucid air sapphire is faster than a lamborghini revuelto and gt4 rs manthey. incredible. i m curious how does it feel to drive a lucid air on the edge? one common complaint i ve read about evs on the track is that there s no engine noise to reference for corner entry speeds. did the drivers have any issues with this lack of noise for both this as well as the taycan? what techniques were used to compensate?
rollsroyce,,105,"my ex gf got a quote from a very famous used car dealer. it s called kavak. here in mexico she was quoted 19 interest, 4 years, 30 downpayment on a corolla xrs manual. her credit score is like 720 or something. the car was worth like 7k usd. it seemed like a good deal but the interest was absurd. yeah, we get effed real good down here... new cars are like 9 or 12 . and it used to be worse."
bentley,,10,the screen is where the three analogue dials are on the dashboard. the panel rotates to show the screen or nothing at all.
ferrari,,26,a porsche designed shisha
porsche,,9,"i m not doubting that it is capable, i m just saying the usual buyer is not the guy who s gonna care much about that, i m willing to bet the of gt2 rs owners that are gonna track their cars is way bigger than the share of svj owners that will do so. the aventador is the quintessential flexmobile lol, just like the murcielago and the diablo were in their time. although i agree that they are more than up to the task should a track day come."
lucid,,6,"well they actually are, they power for example the drivetrain in the formula e cars, among others. the incredible power to weight ratio of their powertrain modules is an extremely good offering to other companies. in formula e it can deliver 469 horsepower from a package containing motor, transmission, differential and inverter that weighs just 32 kg 70.5 lbs ."
ferrari,,176,"definitely. i get absolutely bombarded with questions at gas stations, i get flipped off and thumbs upped a ton of the road. in fact, just this morning on my way to work a teenager took a picture of me behind him in from his side mirror i assume to snap his friends. i get raced at every stoplight by every random civic, mustang, etc, i have people chase me down on the interstate to take videos, and dudes whether driving or in the passenger seat are always pointing at me and speaking to other people in the car. not to mention people on feet always turning their heads as i drive by. and one thing is certain women don t care, lmao. i ve had 2 women ever talk to me about it one because her son loved cars, the other owned a 67 stingray. i never expected the elise to be that much of an attention grabber for just 38.5k although i d be able to sell near 60k in this economy."
rollsroyce,,9,"yeah i will say my model 3 definitely feels the same way. there s sometimes where i am like why do i have to deal with this? and then other times where i am like this is the best thing ever. i will say the tesla driving experience is getting a little stale for me though. the model 3, s, y, and x all feel too similar to me and feel like they re the same cars just packaged in different ways. i kind of feel like tesla s cars sit in this weird place where they aren t quite sporty or driver centric enough, but at the same time aren t exactly luxurious enough either. i kind of wish they released a few models that were less neutral and skewed either direction. i do like the fact that you can pretty much buy one of these without talking to a person. i find it very hard transitioning back to dealerships after having purchased direct through tesla. i ve also found myself basically never having to think about my teslas in my ownership experience and have almost no worry about the car breaking down, needed maintenance etc. like i may have with other ice vehicles."
lucid,,479,i m surprised they even had a factory .
bentley,Bentley,20,"about 200,000 too expensive. cadillac does not have the brand cachet to charge these prices, and while it s an attractive car, it s not timeless like a rolls or bentley. gm needs to mass produce this like mercedes and bmw make the s class and 7 series. exclusive, sure, but attainable enough that people know they exist and believe they have a shot at owning one."
porsche,,23,"yup. unfortunately we never know what is in the cards. i ve become someone that prefers to live life now instead of saving for later. don t get me wrong, i m not throwing money away, i have a house, etc., but i buy cars i will enjoy, if i want a new motorcycle, i buy one. i watched my sister die at 41 from cancer, my mom die at 59 from lung issues heavy smoker and now my dad s health turn to crap at retirement. you just never know. i also have an uncle my dads brother who is almost 80 now and perfectly healthy, my grandfather stayed healthy and active well into his 80 s too. we never know what is to come so i decided to enjoy what i can while i can. i m hoping i live well into my 80 s too but seems to be a crap shoot in my family."
bentley,,43,lmao tucson?? opposite of all those qualifiers
bentley,,3,"honestly, it s the best car i ve ever had. i absolutely love it and i ve never had a bmw before. if you get the chance, you definitely should. especially the m70 it s absurd how fast such a large car is. the only downside is the brakes are not as good as the gas . it s actually ruined me from gas cars. i kinda want a ferrari purosange, but i know i ll end up leaving it in the garage on empty cause i hate going to the gas station, especially in an expensive car. it gives me a lot of anxiety and really was the main reason i wanted to go electric."
bentley,,8,"actually it is. vehicles with rounded backs like that audi tt generate serious lift at high speeds. you will notice that many vehicles with that shape have a retractable spoiler. it s not to add downforce, it s to prevent lift. the original audi tt generated 150 pound of lift over the rear axle at 125 mph. wind resistance and lift increases exponentially so i imagine the problem would be terrible at 150."
tesla,Model S,6,i want 911 s to return to the not so crazy prices. i know it won t happen.
rollsroyce,,4,"yeah i totally agree that the people who entered the industry for the right reasons will most likely have the right skills and passion to allow them to be successful long term. these talented agents are the ones who do a really good job and get recommended by word of mouth. the agents i was bashing are the ones whose only thought process when getting their real estate was i can sell one house for 1 million and make 25,000. i can easilyyyyy sell one house a month. it s easy math bro."
lucid,,5,
ferrari,,82,nah we absolutely needed a guy who loves trains to host grand tour.
rollsroyce,,10,i always pay attention to any vehicles around me. my wife notices me looking in the mirror a lot and has asked why before. i explained that around 500 yards back i can see this driver driving erratically and making dangerous moves through traffic. so what i do it leave enough room for him to get past me safely as i can so he s not around me. they ll one day get into a accident and i do not want any part of it. i like your experiment. i always try to give semis enough room to keep rolling or get out of their way as soon as possible so they don t have to start from a stop. people don t understand it but that helps traffic a lot.
ferrari,,52,"those were all on my cross shopping list as well. i ended up going ttrs because it was the most well rounded. incredibly practical considering the segment awd for snowy road trips without having to switch from a s to winters mesmerizing sounds gorgeous and simple interior very precise steering stupid speed and acceleration 0 60 in 3.39s, 3.12 with rollout and 1 4 mile in 11.5s both on season tires cheap maintenance and parts the other options do some better, but the ttrs is just the entire package."
ferrari,,3,"i know i m really late to the party, but maybe you ll see this still. i have couple of questions about your own collection. how many cars do you have? how often do you buy and sell a car? how do you navigate insurance, maintenance and parking on multiple cars? how do you rotate your own cars? i would love to have a multi car collection, but aside from not being able to afford it, i struggle with the logistics. edit obligatory addition, i love your videos and drive my wife crazy watching them and trying to show her all sorts of quirks and features ."
ferrari,,7,"yeah that s why most professional race series are switching to semi auto, race boys will never let it go, but computers can shift a gear a lot faster and smoother than you ever will be able to with greater consistency, tell it what gear you want and it will do it perfectly. look, i m not knocking it, a sweet gear change is a sweet change, but most people don t care, driving is a means to an end for them, and yes feathering a clutch through traffic for 45mins to an hour kills, near anyone who went or want to go auto where i am u.k. mentions that as one of the primary reasons."
rollsroyce,,11,no they aren t. it s literally in the highway code in my country.
porsche,Porsche,11,"they also ban gopros and other cameras for the same reasons. they don t want clout chasers risking lives for a sick tiktok clip. even private track days highly encourage driving ettiquite of signaling right to move over when you re letting a trailing driver pass and not passing on insides of corners...especially not without a signal the other driver knows you re doing it and is letting you. sometimes you have to wait for a straight to get by slower drivers. it s not a race, and is not an invitation to drive like you re playing forza online. people do die. here is the info from the track day i did with dsk. translated, it explicity prohibits the driving behavior of the porsche driver here."
porsche,Porsche,4,
lucid,,3,"oh shit this is already 4th gen? my point still stands though, ultimately i don t think used evs will hold value well even the most recent generation. sure, these evs are better but the tech behind electric vehicles has yet to mature. we don t know how backwards compatible future evs will be to our current ones, and we don t even know how much support automakers will give to old evs as components read batteries will inevitably need replacing. best case, components in the future can still be used on older models, so the real value in the ev is basically just a frame, 4 wheels and the controls. worst case, and what i fear the most we ll see planned obsolescence of vehicles that ll require buying a new car every 5 years. i shudder at that thought."
ferrari,,118,"weather. always weather. i had a bmw z8 lined up in florida months ago and it rained and i couldn t shoot it. i ve already cancelled six videos this year due to snow ice rain. weather is my greatest annoyance, because scheduling is hell you re not only dealing with your schedule, but also the car owner, the car owner for the next day and the prior day i can t do friday means you move the guy who was on friday to saturday, etc , and your own youtube schedule of can t do too many bmws at once or need this new car to come out first or whatever. then you get through all that and ... it rains."
bentley,,8,
lucid,,36,"the only good interactions i have are when we are both passionate about different niche classic cars, and we mutually listen to each other gush over stupid trivia. it s happened like 3 times in my 10 years of consistently doing car things. every other time, people are just assholes or disinterested. like i can say, oh i love your gsx , and the old guy owner with just glare at me like i fucked his wife. guys my age are no better. if they do talk, they ll be pompous as hell, and then tune out as soon as you say anything. nobody wants to carry a conversation or ask about what the other person likes drives. it s all about showing off for most people, which is cool if you actually did the work, but they usually haven t. sure, i ve had fun listening to old guys tell stories about fun car memories, but they never give a shit about me or my input. it s very one sided. online interactions are awful too. it s always well akchually type of people nitpicking everything you say. oh, or god forbid you ask a slightly silly question about a car you own that enthusiasts don t like. anyone make coilovers for a insert car here and 20 people will tell you you re literally retarded for even asking such blasphemous things. then you ll ask how to make custom coilovers and have 20 people will tell you to just buy ones or to drop dead. it s exhausting. i actually find the hobby very isolating. i enjoy what i like, and learn how to do everything myself, because asking anyone else online is unbearable."
bentley,,29,"more realistic names hyundai fresno, hyundai bakersfield"
ferrari,Ferrari,35,"lol, this is ferrari and not your average v6 and its their new flagship car using f1 tech . it will definitely make that power on 93"
lucid,,3,"if gas cars have to frequently use their brakes, it doesn t help nearly as much compared to an ev that regens."
rollsroyce,,6,"my friend is a private pilot, the folks he flies for usually have a smallish stol short take off and landing turboprop that still has a decent range like a daher tbm or a pilatus pc 12 in addition to the jet s for short flights or going places with short fields. you can land those at any local field of which there are tons. besides being safer than helicopters they can fly in all conditions, they re faster, have way more range, are more comfortable, cheaper to operate and your pilots can be type certified for all your aircraft and you don t need a dedicated helicopter pilot."
lucid,,11,"thanks. that s really unfortunate, i was attracted to it by all the physical properties you mentioned but software usability issues like that are intolerable in a daily driver...."
bentley,,23,"i m no audiophile, but the ml system in the ls sounds nice and full . the number of speakers is a bit hilarious, though."
ferrari,,46,"have you ever heard of a gasifier? you can run a car on wood. look up videos on gasifier powered cars. it s obviously not practical, but you said you love learning things like that. i saw it on a survival reality show called the colony. they powered a tractor with wood by using two tanks, one inside another. burn wood in the outer tank, put wood in the inner tank, the inner tank produces fuel that is piped out. very simplified explanation, but fascinating."
lucid,,4,
rollsroyce,,4,"i ve looked at jobs at tesla many times. i m a very experienced human factors engineer. i always decide against even applying because clearly they don t value human factors or they simply have someone at the top that s shooting it all down. almost everything you mentioned aside from braking should have been addressed by either an ergonomist or hfe. wild that there are so many problems with the human experience, both physical and digital. thanks for sharing your input!"
tesla,Tesla,7,that s not what happened. tesla was first yes but tesla didn t have the money or expertise to be a major manufacturer. that s a key part of why elon made so many big claims and sold things he didn t have. it s because the company needed the cash and interest. usually he was able to get it done but sometimes he had to get more creative and make up things he had no idea about read fsd . today tesla is on better footing and they have all the cash they need too much actually but something interesting happened along the way customers never really cared about quality. so it worked out and they don t need to go back to improve it. which is good for them in the short term since it wouldn t be easy anyway.
porsche,,4,some cars too. the valkyrie probably wouldnt have a good time in the ring because relies a lot on ground effect and the bumpiness of the track will have an effect.
bentley,,9,"probably, and not just to reduce turbo lag. back in the 1940 s aviation engines used turbines in the exhaust stream to recover energy and drive the crankshaft check out the wikipedia page on the wright r 3350 . gave a 20 power boost for the same fuel usage. those engines also had superchargers. so take that one step further, and use a free spinning turbocharger attached to a motor generator. you get 1. less turbo lag using the motor to spin up the turbine 2. more power in the torque band by using the generator instead of a wastegate to limit turbo rpms 3. higher efficiency to meet epa targets when cruising again no wastegate 4. reduced maintenance no wastegate, motor can spin the turbo at low rpm if you shut off the motor hot, etc"
porsche,Porsche,40,this could have been avoided if the m2 driver didn t pull to the right on a corner where you stay left middle leading the porsche driver think m2 is letting them pass. this could have also been avoided if the bmw driver used their mirrors. this could have ofc also been avoided if the porsche driver drove extra safe. i disagree about the patient part. i think the porsche driver is definitely patient. didn t try anything until bmw give him space and then bmw decides to take the space back cutting into a corner you don t even need to cut in for. edit misha agrees with me apparently youtube
bentley,,7,"when i bought my car i fought with my dealer that my consumption was abnormal and they disagreed. a buddy of mine big in the n54 world told me to try this oil and it s the best thing i ve done. there s now a lawsuit and recall on high consumption for my engine, but i m happy with how it s been on this oil. i ve been using it for the last 1.5 years for about 25k miles at 72k miles now with no issues. anecdotal, but might be something to try if your gf otherwise loves the car like i do haha"

porsche,Porsche,749,"my theory is that regular us car buyers aren t car enthusiasts and just want something that carries them from point a to b comfortably. automatics are a lot more convinient than manual transmissions. not every car buyer wants to have fun while driving a manual car while doing daily chores. as pointed out in the reply section, manual transmissions tend to be cheaper in some countries and are therefore popular even amongst non car enthusiasts. sports cars like porsche are specifically sold for their performance. people who buy them drive them specially for fun and racing. in that, manual transmissions excel and provide more fun and control. so, the buyers go for manuals. this theory may be totally wrong though, i m not a market expert."
rollsroyce,Rolls Royce,9,"i m in australia and they are rare but you can certainly find owners enthusiasts around the place, guess its more of a commonwealth thing? the uk rrec rolls royce enthusiast club publishes a quarterly magazine which can be a great source of info. regarding the maintenance cost its an annoying answer but it really depends. i have friends with rr s from this 70 s 90 s time frame and the maintenance cost can be just as affordable, if not more so than the same era of german cars, there are some caveats to this though. in no particular order the overall maintenance standard for collector cars tends to be much, much higher. i know there are bmw and mercedes collectors who can be incredibly anal about the condition of their cars, but this is much more common within classic rr and bentley ownership circles. if you want to keep the engine bay sparkling and free from a single blemish of dripped oil and the leather interior as soft as it was brand new that s all doable but its either a very time consuming or b very expensive. if you re okay to treat it more like an average car and keep up to date with the maintenance servicing, the time cost requirement goes way down but so does resale value . the 90 s cars like the one you tested are danger zone because of the modern tech the typical owner base. its why i would buy an 80 s silver spur over the model you drove, physically almost the same with the trade off being its carburetted so more routine maintenance , but you don t have to stress about the abs module dying... which are now practically unreplaceable if you don t happen to know the right people. which brings me to my next point. the enthusiast owner demographic is very different this has a big impact on the ownership experience. in your 70 s 80 s merc, odds are you can jump online and there will be someone on a forum who can tell you what part you need, you can go to ebay punch in the part and find that exact part right then and there. for these cars, that s almost never going to happen. when something breaks, your options are to pay a rr specialist a wheelbarrow full of money to find the issue and then several more wheelbarrows to replace the part, or you ask around enthusiasts you know in person via the phone. if that doesn t work, you probably write a letter yes, a paper letter , to your state countries rr ownership club president who will know a guru that can either help you or tell you what book you need to look in. once you ve done that, you scour that exact same network for the part. if you re lucky, someone has one. if you re unlucky, you end up putting a note in the uk rolls royce enthusiast club magazine, the spirit every quarter for as long as necessary until some 60 80 year old from bristol writes you a letter saying that if you send them a few hundred pound, they ll ship you one of the half dozen they have of that part sitting around in the garden shed. you could keep one of these on the road for a few thousand a year if you re a willing to accept a bit of wear and tear will happen over time b willing to do a lot of the work yourself c patient if you aren t willing to either own multiple cars to cannibalize, wait 3 6 months to track down a part or pay for a specialist mechanic to sit on the phone for 4 days straight pumping every connection he s got globally for a part, they aren t the car for you. nb don t buy an ex wedding hire car, the huge odometer readings often don t even reflect the actual number of k s miles they have done, the cost of getting it back to anything like its original condition will be way more than just buying a less thrashed one. only scenario where its really a good idea is if you just want a car that looks good from more than 10ft away you re going to be ripping it back to basics and putting a new engine in. in that case its not a terrible idea, but you ll get sick of explaining the background to purists. nb 2 the newer post 2000 ish cars have much, much better parts availability. this is probably due to being newer, more standardised production techniques parts sharing larger production runs. you can ever get a decent range of non oem parts now, which is a godsend or blasphemy, depending on who you ask. tl dr if its your only car don t. if its your second car buy year 2000 or newer if its your third car buy whatever you want maintenance is iron triangle cost, quality, time. pick 2."
rollsroyce,,13,"driving schools in europe don t ask any of that. you can easily be a bad driver and pass at least in portugal , as long as you drive defensively and aren t an idiot. to learn that in a school you have to go to an advanced driving school, completely unrelated to your drivers license. when i got my license i was a pretty terrible driver. but i was also self aware, and made sure i didn t do anything too stupid. the student before me was a far better driver but fell into a trap and failed she was told to turn left whenever possible, the 1st left was a one way street on the opposite direction, she had to turn on the 2nd left i do agree that having driving ed replaced by parent taught is a terrible idea. there s no guarantee the parents know enough for themselves in the first place, let alone to teach someone else. our driving tests aren t much more complex than that but are way longer. you spend a good 30 40mins driving and at any point you can have an instant fail. basically if the examiner has to intervene, you automatically fail idk how they do it in the us, but here the driving education cars have 2 sets of pedals, one on each side, so the examiner can for instance brake for you. if he touches one of the pedals, a warning light lights up and you re failed . the main difference to me seems to be on the theoretical part. we take a theory test with 30 questions 40 if you re taking a license above b , where you fail if you score below 27 30."

rollsroyce,,33,"owner here. i felt the same sense of soullessness on my initial test drive and after first buying it, but it s definitely changed over time. i think the soul comes from being a direct extension of my will, in how instant and linear the acceleration is. now driving ice cars makes me painfully aware of the lag between input and acceleration and inconsistent nature of the pedal. i mostly agree with everything in op s review, though maybe that stuff just bothers me less. the seat is fine for me though the headrest is weirdly intrusive. the negatives of the glass roof allowing too much sun heat, dead but heavy in sport steering, lack of carplay and ventilated seats i all agree with. it s really an odd mix of both amazing powertrain, ui, efficiency and economy some interior aspects, energy efficiency and weird glass roof, mirror viability, no gauges buttons other than touch screen ."

bentley,,6,"vw is moving upmarket phaeton, arteon somewhat, and porsche hasn t really moved, so as audi is more or less positioned between those two brands, the price range they can operate at is kinda narrowing. model range narrowing isn t really tied to that, but more to the fact that audi is running low on cash buffer, so they have to pick out models with better margins to focus on instead of tons of variants of tons of models. i d imagine porsche capping off their higher end disallows the option of pricing up for better margins, too."

lucid,Lucid,12,"basically zero cars would have been delivered to customers after they fixed the issue on may 4. i m still waiting on mine and it was delivered to the service center for pdi on may 13, which is before they had this recall, meaning mine was probably built right in the last couple days of the issue. so not having mine yet, i can assume that anything built after may 4 hasn t been delivered either. those waiting for delivery knew there was an issue for the last week and a half or so, but lucid wouldn t tell us what it was until the public release of the recall. frustrating, but it s a brand new car company so not really unexpected."
porsche,,173,"while not as severe as your instance, i lived in a house for 8 years where there were regular vehicle accidents, for similar reasons to yours and then some! being near the end of a straight away, there were two fatal motorcycle wrecks as the result of trying to take the curve at over a hundred. i knew the person who died in both instances not well, but still. even if you are wearing a helmet, a tree does not care at that speed. in the other direction, people will lose control and come reeeeal close to taking out my mailbox. one time, a lady passed out at the wheel, went off the road, taking out my mailbox, hitting the ditch as if were a ramp, travelling through my neighbors yard and coming to a stop in a bush. ended up climbing through the window of her car myself and eventually pulled her out of the car so we could start chest compressions. that s a fun story to tell! edit my favorite one is actually documented. sitting at home one night in october and hear a loud bang and crash. walk outside to what can only be described as a warzone. pics video"

porsche,,5,"i ll start by saying thank you so much op for posting this experience and getting the rants going! my so and i purchased our first kia rio 5 in 2013 and have never experienced a company worse than kia when it comes to customer service. i am so glad i have this great opportunity to rant as well. our nightmares need to be shared with the rest of you. as a prelude to the lengthy next bit that s about to come, i will say this i want kia to disappear! that s how terrible of a company they are. i will lay out as many of our bad experiences that i can remember in chronological order leading up to the very recent and most defining last one. 1. bought our car in early january 2013. financing option wasn t the issue at all. the car came with factory installed tint. a welcome touch or so we thought . we also bought the extended bumper to bumper warranty 8y, 160k . 2. within a month, the rear right bumper reflector lens falls out without any known impact. i take it in and am charged over 200 to replace. 3. a week later i am called by the dealer and asked to come in for an unscheduled minor recall issue. turns out my car didn t come with the right floor matts. 4. a week or two later the aforementioned tint starts peeling off the driver window. i schedule an appointment to bring it in. they tell me the tint guy is outsourced and can only perform the service on saturdays when they open 7 or 8 am . i get there only to find out the tint guy is late. i wait 2 hours and he never shows. the gm apologizes and tells me he will get the tint guy to come to my house and do the job outside. i doubted him right away it was winter but for some naive reason, i gave him the benefit of the doubt. 5. later that week the dealership calls me to confirm my thoughts. the tint guy can only do it at the shop and i still need to accommodate his schedule. i come in again and leave the car to get the tint done. 6. when the job is done i ask if all the windows were redone and am told there is no need. one of the salespeople says eight to me that that is bs and i should expect more tint to peel. the dealer still won t do anything unless something else peels. 7. less than a month later 2 more windows start to peel. also, the manual transmission seems to be making a weird sund when in low gears. 8. i bring the car in unscheduled on a weekend and while waiting for the dealer to bring my car in for service, the gm finds me and asks me why i m there again. i bring him to the car to show him and he right away tells me i have a lemon or a bad luck car. he reminds me that i originally wanted the higher trim model sx and in black i settled for some ugly orangey color . when i had originally purchased, those options weren t available but that day, the exact one i wanted was sitting on the lot new. 9. the gm gets me out of the old into the new the same day. this was my first second car purchase and unfortunately i wasn t diligent enough when making the switch. i hadn t realized until it was pointed out to me a couple years later, that the gm had burried the negative equity off the trade in right into my financing agreement. 10. i ask the gm for a 500 gas card for everything i ve been through and he agrees i deserve one but says there is nothing he can do about it and suggests i call kia canada yes this was in canada. a bigger hint is that it was in ontario , and speak to the customer experience department. he even tells me to involve him and he will back me up. 11. i call kia canada and tell my story to the correct department. my case is instantly escalated to the head of this department. she and i spend days going back and forth arguing as she investigates the case. she eventually even acknowledges that the gm made the suggestion and stands by me but still says no. she and the gm start battling it out until the gm returns to me and says he can t help. its basically out if his jurisdiction. he tells me to call back one final time and put up a real fight. 12. i call the head of the customer experience department for all of canada and at this point she is so frustrated by our week long back and forth a that she ends it with a final...... fuck off! . you read that right. the head of kia canada s customer experience department spewed those words out and put the nail in the coffin with that. 13. we decided to move on and just enjoy our new car. 14. about 8 9 months into ownership, one exteremly cold winter night after working outside for 8 hours valet parking for an event , the car konks out about 1km from my house. i push it all the way to our driveway and use our seemingly fantastic warranty to have the vehicle towed to the dealer. to avoid going through the headaches we suffered with the last car, i have it towed to a different, much further dealer. someone i knew who also owned a kia and agreed the dealer i bought the car from stunk, said he d had much better experience with this one. 15. i go to the dealer and find out that the yaw rate sensor and one other sensor were malfunctioning and not allowing the fuel to make it to the motor. they would have to be replaced but were not in stock. so now leaving the car this far away and not being able to come home with it the same day seemed stupid. so i had them bring it back to the original dealer to make my life easy. 16. once it gets to the other dealer they indicate that the entire diagnosis needs to be done again because each dealer is independent and regardless of the results they share, it must be done by them. fine! 17. over the next few years i tried avoiding all dealerships for all regular maintenance and was pretty successful in doing so. however, eventually, i began to notice the fuel consumption increasing drastically. i tried 2 other kia dealers in my area in my endeavour to find a good one and experienced the same crap eevrywhere. 18. as well, over the years i ve had to replace the backup camera and entire nav unit as they too became defective. 18. when it came to the fuel consumption issue, that battle was lost when the head mechanic showed me a chart created by kia that showed that there was an acceptable range for fuel consumption and my car was still in it. the range was ridiculously huge and once again, kia got their way. today, i get an average of 330km to a tank. i barely drive it for the last 18 months though on the count of working from home since. 19. fast forward to about 1 month ago. i went to my dealer because the transmission was slipping, the rear left caliper was leaking, and both shock bushings were worn and needed replacing. i found this out while getting a safety check which i obviously did not pass. if anyone is wondering, yes, i have been 1000 on top of all scheduled maintenance. as well, i thought to mention that both front seatbelts were no longer retracting and the drivers side door and gear shifters paint had been coming off over the years. i was hoping all this would be covered by my amazing warranty. 20. i come in for the diagnosis and they tell me that my warranty is 3rd party and not offered by kia anymore. they aren t sure what it covers by they believe it is the best one and even better than their current warranties. the first thing they discover is that there is a 250 deductible per claim. so, to avoid having me make 2 separate claims, they indicate that the first plan of attack is to perform a transmission fluid flush to see if the slipping goes away. if after a week it seems okay, then they will put the claims in without the transmission. however, if after the flush nothing changes, they will submit with. 21. i show them the exact maintenance schedule i ve been following that was provided to me by them when i first bought the car and point out that it does not indicate my car ever needs a flush. they say i m actually about 40k km past due but it won t affect my warranty because i was in fact never told this is required. they charge me the usual dealer rip off rate to do something my car apparently didn t need. 22. the issue goes away and after a week of driving the car, i call the dealer back to tell them to file the claim without a transmission job. 23. the dealer gets back to me a week later and indicates that the caliper and shocks are covered but not the seatbelts or paint. great warranty! if mine is one of the best, how does it get worse from here? 24. i bring the car in for the warranty work and this is where things get so sour, we posted a yelp review about this experience. now you get to hear about to too! this next experience was the deciding factor of whether or not we renew our loan agreement after maturity this april and enjoy the extended warranty until the km run out or buy something else."
ferrari,,30,"gm hit it out of the park with this car. instead of competition with supercars it went to the next level. if dodge ever brings back the viper, it will need to have a ton of power too and keep it relatively lightweight. we already have 2000 3000whp vipers. dodge should get an nth moto built 2300whp viper, they build them with a beefed up manual 6 speed too. use that car as a basis of whats possible while still being front mid engine rwd."
ferrari,,4,wasn t it a tiny bit slower than lucid air sapphire?
bentley,,25,"while that s a fair opinion, i think op has a solid point that the older stuff has certain desirable qualities that are gone on the new stuff. i grew up with the 2000s cars and i am most certainly not fond of them, but that wasn t really a great period for american luxury. but for me, the older cars have distinctly american comf barge look that i don t see on the 2000s and newer cars. one other great feature of the older cars is interior space for the driver. looking at the op s picture, the older models have a very spacious front seat while the new models have massive center consoles that to me make everything seem quite cramped. maybe it s the company chasing that sporty cockpit feel, but i think more space would feel more luxurious."

lucid,,5,"the etron gt is stunning. i m not sold on the a6 etron, though, and want to see it in person. it looks great from some angles, but directly from the side it looks too tall and thick. gorden wagener head of daimler design said the reason they went for such an unconventional look for the eq cars is because regular sedan shapes look like crap when built on top of a thick battery pack. wagener s solution was not the answer, but the a6 etron is a good example of what he was talking about. it looks awkwardly tall and bulky in the middle and lacks the elegance and athleticism of audi s ice cars."

bentley,,3,"another con you forgot to mention is poor cargo capacity and back seat room. it s been remarked about by almost everyone who reviews the g70 that the cargo capacity and back seat room are just not up to par compared to the rest of the class. for most everyday scenarios, they probably work just fine. but when you have 6 0 adults in the back, or you need to haul your whole family plus their suitcases to the airport the g70 will be significantly worse at that task than a 3 series or a4."

ferrari,,45,sell it on cars bids at no reserve and let doug get in on the action.
rollsroyce,,3,"this is always unpopular but i m going to put my personal pet peeve out there the proliferation of dark window tint has made the roads less safe. sure, trucks have always been big, but it was easier to see around or see through this truck than this truck other folks have rightly pointed out that higher hoods and crew cabs everywhere have made trucks feel bigger. i think the fact that the typical new truck is also much more visually opaque contributes to that feeling as well. now that everyone drives cuvs suvs, 4 door pickups and minivans, and those vehicles are lawfully allowed to have darker rear window tint than the no longer popular 2 door pickups, sedans, coupes and wagons, when you look around on a crowded street it can just be a slot canyon of black glass."
bentley,Bentley,16,"all we can do is speculate, but i don t think it s that weird to sell off unprofitable or underperforming brands to free up resources for a big production pivot. and like i speculated below, getting rid of lamborghini might primarily be a way to get rid of bugatti and or bentley. hard to say. it also could be a way to keep things looking good to investors on paper for quarterly and annual reports. like, they could invest heavily in ev development right now with their cash and show a loss or less profit for several years, or they could sell off some stuff, keep the numbers looking great short term and still hopefully set themselves up for success long term."
porsche,Porsche,3,"yea they are one of the most reliable brands. also i m not in my 20s anymore, my ego is a bit more in check lol and i don t need the absolute fastest car on the road. any of the new sports cars in that range will be plenty fast enough for me. porsche is a level of refinement way above the rest in class. plus i love how they have confidence in their classic designs and don t need to reinvent themselves to go after another market or whatever bmw is trying to do."
lucid,Lucid,7,"there are engineering disciplines which specialize in design for manufacturing and design for maintenance. does lucid have any of these engineers on staff? idk, but there are plenty of engineers in the world with good minds for making something easy to service. it is usually fighting with the industrial design guys that makes for complicated designs. as one who spent a decade engineering business class aircraft furniture, i had plenty of arguments discussions with our ids."
rollsroyce,,8,"i ve sat in one and its fine. it s not as bad as the mg4 base model though i haven t tried the new essential trim, which is more basic and the mg4 causes some people serious back pain, but the ora wipes the floor with it internally aside from luggage space. it s also far smaller than a 4 for a similar price or an ora on discount , at least in australia, and the 4 in particular has a far better motor and battery for the money. and any law that allowed byd to sell in the us would likely allow them in too. the renault 5 also looks amazing but is not yet here the other problem is that in australia the only non monochrome colours are pink and blue, and if you get pink you get a pink metallic interior which looks absolutely awful, so there s effectively one colour option if you want an acceptable interior. meanwhile the ora has 2 3 and the mg has 3 4 depending on trim. it s not the car i d pick if i was looking for a chinese ev b segment, that s for sure."
lucid,,30,"if cars for you boil down to just the engine, you may as well do a rwd b58 conversion on a camry and call it a day. i test drove both and made an informed decision. the 8k savings was just the cherry on top. the supra s shifter is kind of weird and rubbery, the visibility sucks for a person of my height, and the wind buffeting problem is awful. otoh the ride is great and the cabin is quiet. the engine has a beautiful torque curve and is obviously putting out more power than toyota claim. overall the supra feels like a modern car, by which i mean it s refined but also a bit numb. i ve had a tt a80 supra, and the new one is nothing like it. there s no nostalgia there for me. the z ride is floaty and the rear end feels like it wants to do its own thing. the exhaust is too quiet. but the shifter is great, visibility is fine, and i can drive with the windows down. an aftermarket exhaust and chassis bracing fixed my issues with it anyway. overall the z feels like an old school jdm car with modern power. it feels more raw than the supra and scratches a nostalgic itch i have for how cars used to drive. when i want refined and modern, i have other cars for that. when i want to rip shit and relive my teens, i take the z."
porsche,Porsche,7,"i m not saying chevy is unreliable. i m saying even the worst porsche model is far and away more reliable than eve the best chevy models. chevy isn t bad, it s just not as good as porsche when it comes to reliability. it comes with the territory of making a lower budget car, generally speaking. comparing the 992 gt3 to even the c7 z06 only makes the comparison worse, considering chevy becomes less and less reliable in their highest tier performance models."
bentley,,11,"while diesel won t be banned, it will be forced out. a lot of european cities have started a policy where only extremely clean vehicles into city centers. that area where unclean cars are not allowed is slowly expanding outward. also, multiple studies have shown that electric cars are more clean than gasoline cars, and will continue to emit less and less as the grid becomes more clean."
porsche,,71,"it s utterly devastating. he s had a great life, but he still had so much more to live. you can tell how excited he was to try and win the ara title next year at the end of his recent documentary. then you have the build videos with his daughter. his wife also recently got into rallying. from my understanding, they weren t forced into it. they both genuinely wanted to do it and get to spend more time with their dad. while i was at stpr this year, i unfortunately did not get a chance to meet ken as i ran out of time before the stages began. it s unfortunate because now i ll never get that chance. the guy is a huge inspiration. most guys grow up wishing they could be a racecar driver but our financial circumstances usually take us on another career path. ken didn t let that stop him. he made his money elsewhere and then used that to live out his childhood dreams at an age when most people give up on them or retire comfortably when you have his wealth. i often feel he was underrated by the rallying community because of his viral popularity. he genuinely improved every year as a driver. he got to help start two major clothing and entertainment brands in the 21st century, own a lot of his dream cars, race in many historic races when most would kill to be part of just one of them, and he has a good family that i feel immensely sorry for. i don t know her personally, but lia seems like a good kid who stays out of trouble and knows the value of work. rip ken."
tesla,Tesla,16,i don t own a tesla but the main thing that would draw me towards one is the dealership free experience. you just get the same price as everyone else and order it. i know traditional manufacturers are trying to replicate this now with their buy online deals but you still have to go through a dealership and deal with all their nonsense.
porsche,,34,"yep. the dealer i bought my stinger from was excellent. never once pressured me maybe because he could tell i was already sold before i even walked through the door , never gave me any trouble with a test drive, never fed me bs info and answered any and all questions i had. the sales process with them took about a month was waiting for the one i wanted to show up in their inventory before i was ready to commit and they were never pushy. that being said, i ve heard far too many of these stories to believe they are just rare anomalies, and our purchase of a 2014 soul a few years ago wasn t quite as laid back still not too bad though ."
rollsroyce,,3,"not op but i owned a 987.2 and currently own a 718 cayman s. exactly what these cars are depends a lot on how you spec them, but my general feeling was that the 987 is a truly phenomenal sportscar. perfect manual gearbox, perfect ergonomics, perfect steering. it doesn t feel fast by modern standards, but the engine sounds wonderful, power is linear, and it makes you work to enjoy it. that said, i thought it was a rather bad daily driver. absolutely no amenities or technology, mine had a number of reliability issues with under 35k miles, and the cabin is very spartan. the 718 is not as pure of a driver s car. the electric steering has lost some feel, the turbo 4 cylinder has less character and a worse sound than the flat 6, and it feels a little larger and less nimble. however it s my favorite daily driver i ve ever owned. mine is specced out with a lot of options, which does add to the cost. sticker was over 100k new. but it has an absolutely beautiful interior all of the tech i could need or want, lovely tactile buttons, and it s truly comfortable for long drives. what the engine has lost in character it s gained in power the 718 s is a seriously quick car, especially with pdk. 0 60 in 3.5 seconds, and just under 12 seconds quarter mile. while i say that it s lost some driving feel compared to the 987, it still drives better than 99 of anything you d ever see on the road. the steering is the best electric system i ve ever experienced, the pdk is flawless for both spirited and comfortable driving, and the chassis and suspension are just wonderful. to wrap up, my thoughts are basically that if you want an amazing weekend track car that you won t daily, buy a 987.2 s in a manual. if you want to daily drive a rocketship with a leather wrapped interior and some of the best driving dynamics in the post hydraulic steering era, buy a 718 s with pdk."
tesla,,75,"in all seriousness, and the reason i took his little quick! watch this before their lawyers! half clickbait nonsense out of the video, is because there is little to no precedence for that at least in the us, there have been like three cases one with byd, targeting aam, and one with deer like 10 years ago targeting a blogger , and both were thrown out. if they do sue, its free money. but that is the interesting bit with china, they have such a large domestic market and such tight control over it, alongside anti slapp laws internationally and considering the streisand effect, there isn t much good out of targeting individuals internationally. i am fairly sure jay will end up just fine. i absolutely love some of his longer form reviews on the older cars, particularly older ferraris, as well as his european perspective on cars like the challenger, 300c, c8, etc., but i ll be honest i wasn t ever really a fan of the report bits but it does highlight his big underlying correct point that in the us and elsewhere a company would need to prove i have actual malicious intent i may be wrong here and there, but i m not out to get anyone. in china however, simply being wrong and causing reputational damage could put me in a position for civil damages or criminal charges."
porsche,,23,"here s my counterpoint if you are not conscious of the trend of your net worth over time, you ll struggle to build wealth your entire life. i care about the values of my cars and where they re going because the cars i own are not my endgame dream cars. the only way i will obtain my dream cars is if i ensure my net worth trends positive year over year. if i buy a brand new car, that car will actively work against me building wealth. i say this as both a car guy and someone who wants to retire comfortably. i would love a brand new 4runner right now and can in fact afford one. as far as brand new cars go, it s also a very resilient choice in terms of holding resale value. but at the end of the day, it ll still depreciate whereas my 16 year old 4runner has only appreciated during the past year as used car values boomed. everyone has different goals. if you want to enjoy that new bmw right now and can afford it, go for it. i d like to be able to buy a brand new gt3 or the like at some point within the next few decades. i need to be strategic about my finances."

porsche,,5,"you re not wrong, but clearly gm doesn t care that much. they had no shot at 1, so they kind of made the whole thing more relatable. but if you look back to the z06 doing a 7 10.51 piloted by a nurburgring specialist and then the engineer doing a 7 11.8, it s pretty good. there s so much nuance to it that it just becomes ridiculous to keep up with. like the guy who did the 7 10 that was in the fall on a cold day... how much time was that cost? and that wasn t an unlimited budget factory effort... just a handful of engineers and mechanics. and misha said that guy left ten seconds on the table... so the real target for a z06 is sub 7 in the fall???... but that s hypothetical. one ring guru saying another ring guru left ten seconds on the tables seems a little far fetched."

porsche,Porsche,11,it s the porsche strategy for c d. the gt4 spyder gt4rs spyderrs got best sports car every year because the base cayman is under 75k. the 911 wasn t eligible because the base 911 was over 100k still. extremely inaccurate but they re consistent in how they use the cheapest price as the barrier to entry even if the car can option to 2 3x that base price.
bentley,,95,"remote keyless entry was rare in 1990. which cars had it? i ve reviewed top line cars from every brand from that era mb, bmw, ferrari, land rover, etc and none of them had it. it didn t become common until the mid 1990s, and even then it was mostly optional on luxury brands. we quickly forget what features we didn t have, but this is still relatively new, even though it seems like it wasn t. also, i m not sure about you, but my family didn t have a car with heated seats until 2004. it was becoming common in luxury cars in the 1990s, but it was by no means ubiquitous."
tesla,Tesla,9,"i don t think tesla will lose the case but i wouldn t be surprised if they do a settlement payout because there s no point in the car being able to detect, after it s been overided by the driver that it s driving straight towards another car and a person if the car can t override the driver and i think elon might just think in the end that it makes more sense for a payout to be done rather then end the situation in a way that says hey tesla isn t liable, rip to naibel"

tesla,Tesla,36,"so. the problem with ai today is twofold ml is not ai as a massive oversimplification, machine learning is not intelligence. it is statistics, or answering what is the most probable common outcome to this input? . it is not symbolic but numerical. i curated the wiki entry on ml here for some more sources and an in depth look at the field of statistics ml. ml is biased the second biggest problem for ml is that the training is not dynamic, but instead it is the foundation through which the algorithm analyses data. again i ll oversimplify but training an ml algorithm is the process and it takes a lot of forms and shapes in which the model crafts a statistical formula, which it then applies to real data. this means that the results of ml algorithms are always dependent on that initial training phase. which is dependent on the initial set of data upon which i launched the training. you see where i am going you need all the possible permutations of a dataset in order to be even remotely accurate. in case of tesla, for an ml algorithm that recognises obstacles they would need a good generalisation of every possible obstacle in existence before reaching any semblance of accuracy. but hey, can t the ml algorithm learn from enviroment? no. because ml is dumb and rigid as a rock, it is not ai, it doesn t have semantic and episodic memory. the imprinting of the training is what keeps it together. you can replace ml algorithms one after the other, but the training is not stochastic, it has minimal weight fluctuations each time a new batch is launched, and it operates in a black box. the more complex the algo, the more divergent are the different versions. and every time it has to starts from zero. get the training dataset, launch the model, test it and release into production. over and over with the only improvement that can be made is the initial training data. which is, for things like tesla, many billions of individually curated images videos datastreams. good luck finding antagonistic data in there by this point, there are some people making serious bank just by processing segmented data through mechanical turk. the current consensus is that ml doesn t display the qualities that are associated with artificial intelligence for these reasons, and it cannot be used for decision making. while there are some frindge ml technologies that approach gofai like outcomes, anything outside of marketing claiming that it is ai is sexier that ml that needs to work anything automated on a battlefield uses cognitive architectures developed by dedicated research centres. tesla is stuck with a lot of very expensive data, a lot of a data scientists that have to justify their paychecks, but since 2013 there are no ai architects in there."

tesla,,24,"dude, just put it into 4x4. my dad upgraded from an open diff rwd 2001 silverado 1500 to a 4x4 2001 silverado with a limited slip diff for this exact reason. honestly that was all it took, he doesn t even have to use the 4x4. i swear the 4x4 version weighs more in the back too, it s a lot more stable in general. the back would get squirrelly in the rain on the 2wd even just taking corners without using any gas , if you came in too hot."
tesla,,7,"the largest car market in the world is china, champ."
rollsroyce,Rolls Royce,4,
porsche,,11,nah porches s cheque just got there sooner
bentley,,5,"it was a lease, but i bought it out and sold it. the hit wasn t to bad, somehow i lucked out finding an m3 in inventory when anyone who wants one is stuck waiting like 9 months so i sold it for over msrp. doing the math i simply paid the monthly lease payment for 6 months is what it came out to, which i don t think is bad at all. i got rid of it because i wanted a manual. fast automatics all feel the same to me, after a while i just want to be engaged so i wanted a manual again. sales tax works the same as most places, except i pay 13 . any trade in reduces the amount. the money i got from selling the c8 helps a bit but this is certainly by no means something i can just keep doing forever."
bentley,,107,"quebec requires f for fleet license plates, apparently even on cars leased for personal use."
lucid,,11,"well, i can t deny that the interior of the lower trims is technically closer to the interior quality of a model 3, but i would say it is still a far cry from it. regarding anything requiring servicing, i ve only seen replacements of motors or the hv battery taking a few weeks to a month to get replaced, but smaller issues i.e. trunk fitment get fixed within hours with their mobile service. they also provide loaners if your car is in for servicing, but if none are available at the time, they ll do their best with providing you with a rental or helping you out with getting one."
rollsroyce,,940,"i m not sure if it s of interest, and i m not going to make a whole i bought a post, but i m here and happy to answer some questions about this purchase if people have any. it has been such a lovely first week with it and my fianc is tired of listening to me go on about it. but maybe you lot aren t. i hope edit this toyota century promo from 14 years ago is a fun annex of warmth to our video"
tesla,Model S,1,"underneath it has been almost completely redesigned with the changes to the cooling system, motors , and fuses. interior and exterior they have flopped on. source evwest"
bentley,,12,"which is funny because that s a play on imaginary players by jay z i mean, like, be truthful man, how you think you gon feel, right? you pull up in your 4.0 with your bitch i pull up in the 4.6 with my bitch with the seat back bumping some other shit, you know, some other shit you ll probably hop on my dick right there, right in front of your bitch ask me some stupid shit like yo, yo dog, what s the difference between a 4.0 and a 4.6? like 30 to 40 grand, cocksucker, beat it yo, them shits even got leathers?"
rollsroyce,,20,"i really wish it were possible achieve the tonal changes of a loud exhaust, the raspyness and tambre and depth that we all instantly recognize of oh shit that s fire but without the sheer quantity of volume that it often required to achieve it. i don t want something that s 120db at 6 meters, which is what all these noise regs are trying to combat. i m sure there are physics reasons, but a guy can dream eh."
tesla,Tesla,38,"i think tesla relies on announcement hype far too much. they announce the cybertruck to make sure they re the company that comes to mind when you think about buying an electric truck. this is all well and good until competitors are able to announce, manufacture, and deliver a vehicle before tesla even starts production. this has happened a few times now. i wouldn t be surprised if they kill the brand by continuing to make hollow promises. it s kind of a shame because tesla was one of the first to give ev a massive push forward."
tesla,Model S,2,"had a 2022 civic with steering issues. didn t feel or sound very well put together either. infotainment issues for the 1st 6 months until an aa update fixed it. honda sense 2 also felt like a beta product and would brake randomly or pull the wheel when unnecessary. adaptive cruise would brake like a teenager learning to drive. the vehicle looked and drove nice but felt very underbaked and rushed. 1st year problems? maybe. car also had grind in 2nd from time to time and awful engine tuning. traded it in around a year of ownership and won t consider honda again. my 2015 had a couple ac issues fixed under warranty but otherwise has been a good car. leaking rear shocks are the only thing not scheduled i ve had to do otherwise. we still have this car and it s going strong. couple rattles but easily fixable and nowhere near as bad as the 2022 which had a rattle, buzz, or crack and pops coming from basically every surface. it s anecdotal but that s been my experience with honda."
porsche,,3,what about the panamera hybrid with the new hydraulic suspension? reviewers of that are comparing it directly to a roller in terms of ride quality which is incredible.
ferrari,,9,it s also the laf s v12. which is something special in its own right
tesla,Tesla,3,"i m not a big fan of the tesla, however i m not a fan of consumer reports either. i was a long time member, but canned them long ago. they are very biased in their reviews. back in the 90 s, gm and toyota produced a car brand named geo. they were the exact same models under the geo as were sold under the toyota nameplate. looking at the reviews, the toyota scored extremely well and the geo or gm branded cars were panned. prices were the same, as were the warrantees. they have only gotten worse over the years. imho there are much better places to find reviews and advice on items than you ll find there."
bentley,,13,"montana plates drive me insane. high end exotics that see the road a few times a year? a bit irritating. you can afford the car, pay the taxes. what really pisses me off are the assholes that have montana plates on their daily drivers. we share the road, pay your taxes, assholes."
bentley,,12,"american auto companies lobbied so hard to ban chinese evs from entering the us because chinese companies were making good evs that were actually affordable, only to walk back their ev goals right after getting what they wanted. the us auto industry is so fucked. we re just not allowed to have any cheap cars anymore i guess."
rollsroyce,,3,you don t understand it s rare so it must clearly be good! surely ferrari s production quality is not ass
tesla,,4,
bentley,,46,"it s all to craft the image of luxury. most buyers of those cars will never use that feature. vast majority of rolls royce buyers drive it themselves, and for the one s that have a full time chauffeur, most of them aren t sipping champagne like in the movies because it s bit of a silly thing to do in a car. from my observation, those ultra rich guys that are getting chauffeured just want to power nap or manage emails between meetings. but people think of the car differently knowing that it is possible to store and drink cold champagne in the back seat."
rollsroyce,,9,"well that s debatable or a matter of opinion , i think. i personally compare it to something i m personally highly invested in i love a really nice bespoke suit and own a couple. the attention to detail and level of comfort and care in manufacturing is a lot different than the 500 ones i pick up from brooks brothers. if we make the same rolls to lexus analogy i can see it. i ve never sat in a rolls but if the analogy flies then it s not just the same kind of artisans , it s the difference between pieced together by a machine and reviewed by qc and handcrafted with care and attention to every minute detail from fit to finish . it s the difference between a luxury item and an item of luxury, maybe."
bentley,,3,"what makes a car stand out in a positive way, even if its lap times don t set it apart?"
porsche,,4,"on top of being twice the price, the sapphire also has 100mi less range due to the less aerodynamic rims stickier tyres, no option for a glass canopy for improved structural rigidity and less weight, no options for colors or interior, more bolstered seats, etc. you are making some compromises for performance here"
tesla,Model S,2,just measure max g force in every direction
ferrari,,7,"same reason wrx s with the cvt are slow as donkey shit from a roll. like, i walked my friend s in my mazda 3 2.5l with 80 less hp from a 20 kph roll to about 90 kph. the wrx is obviously a much faster car in practice it just takes forever to spool and that transmission is dog shit. the 5 60 mph time on that car is well over 7 seconds, about a second and a half off it s 0 60 time."
bentley,,8,"so the 911 to me anyway, has better shifter feel, clutch and throttle response vs the z06. turn in feels sharper but the car is a little smaller then my z06 and with rear wheel steering it makes sense it might feel a bit more nimble around town at slower speeds. i m sure if i pushed both at a track the z06 would have superior grip and cornering ability thanks to those fat tires but around town it feels easier to throw the 911 into a turn. the 911s suspension is also softer. my c8 s dct was pretty great, fast shifts, not very annoying in town or in traffic, i d imagine a pdk is just as good or better."
porsche,,16,"the chinese want to buy 20,000 evs made by cellphone companies now."
porsche,Macan,13,the fingerprint magnet center console drives me crazy on the 2022 and up models. i test drove the 2023 macan s and switched my search to a 2019 21 gts. i think that s the ideal macan.

lucid,Lucid,4,
tesla,,3,"why can t they derive 12v from 48v, you essentially need two resistors. doing the opposite would be a pain but what s the issue with reducing voltage ?"
porsche,,32,"looking at overall sales, mercedes is at the top with audi second and bmw third. it s white clear to see this translate into the model range mercedes released an all new c class in 2015 and audi released their all new a4 in 2016, where s bmw is only going to release their new 3 series in early 2019 and it looks more like an evolution rather than a new model at least as far as looks and interior are concerned . bmw is still making the same model 3 series they released in 2012, and the same 1 series they released in that same year, they are just moving too slow with the new models. so bmw has definitely lagged behind in terms of new model releases across the range, mercedes is almost always the brand that introduces their newest product first and only then followed by audi and bmw last. with a few exceptions of course . their other brand, mini, has also been struggling a little bit in the last few years without the introduction of anything worthwhile, in the meantime the hatchback market just keeps getting better and better. and while rr is doing well, it s just too small to have that big of an impact on the overall business."

rollsroyce,,5,"i literally just passed my prof. engineer test so let me tell you you are a dumbass. no single rule or concept exists in a vacuum devoid of context. your basically acting like a diehard originalist or 10 commandment bible humper. sae is a standard, but driving tests are the law you will fail with your foolish mentality. some cars have massive blind spots in the a pillar. cars merging from two lanes over don t get caught in the perfect mirror setup. most driving reccomendations around parking and reversing insist on constantly looking around for people and objects. but no, you read 1 rule and your the big correct strong man and totally the first person to ever have the big balls to criticise journalism."
tesla,Model S,2,this is more how i see it too. it reminds me of the nokia situation. the leaders of the next generation of cars won t necessarily be the ice specialists.

bentley,,6,"the weight would be an issue in european markets, as anything above 3500 kg requires another license."
tesla,,3,i had my motorcycle s gauge cluster replaced under warranty. they did not reprogram the odometer to the old mileage. they said they couldn t when i asked them to do it.
ferrari,,20,"you re a cocky prick if you think proper hill starts not rolling back at all. i m not talking a foot of roll back. a few inches is normal and even the best drivers roll back a little bit. unfortunately, there are plenty of dunderheads out there that will pull up to within a few inches of you. also, using the handbrake to start is a training tool. you shouldn t be doing it all the time. it s bad for your clutch and your rear brakes. if you re going to be wearing a wear component, wear only one and just use the clutch the way you re supposed to. proper hill starts aren t done with the handbrake. edit to be clear, i m not saying you can t use the handbrake, or that it doesn t work. i m saying it s not what you should rely on, and it s certainly not an indication of a good manual driver."
bentley,,83,"ha i mean, not necessarily surprised but it s just sad some people feel they need to rent an expensive flashy car to impress others they most likely don t even know."
ferrari,,3,"i find this to be a perfect argument for wanting a larger engine. electrics and hybrids can take the fastest 0 60 times, but at a certain point it s just not practical anymore. it s soulless speed that is frankly too dangerous to use without lots of risk and anxiety. a manual v8 or flat 6 turbo provides a much more engaging experience. i can imagine people who grow up driving electrics or hybrids lighting up the first time they actually get into a classic ice sports muscle car. it s almost unheard of to hear any hate for someone driving a classic mustang these days afterall."
ferrari,,3,"i work with a guy that bought his first harley. i m not a motorcycle guy, but he got it decked out with all of the options. he spent 25k on this bike, then when it arrived, he hated it. i asked him if it felt different than the one he test rode. he said they don t allow test rides. so he spent 2 times the cost of the fastest bike on the road for a bike that he had never ridden. i think people just buy them for the sound they make."
ferrari,,126,"yes a 787b on modern rubber would dog walk a nevera around a track but in a straight line, a rimac would make a 787b go backwards."
ferrari,Ferrari,70,"the holy trinity monicker worked on the og 3 because those were truly the peak of sportscars everybody knew them and they were undeniably better than everything else coming out, and they had to prove their worth or people wouldn t buy them. they weren t even that expensive to begin with the enzo was a fourth of the price of the f80, the laferrari was 2 fifths of an f80. the p1, carrera gt and 918 were also cheap, when compared and adjusted for inflation. the f80 is 5m because it will sell no matter what. today, every brand and their mom grabs a holy water spray bottle and gets the multi million dollar tag dripping all over the saudi garage. if everything is a god, nothing is holy."
ferrari,,5,don t you guys have phones? also comes to mind
bentley,,5,looking ahead and giving enough distance even extra distance has saved my hide a lot. i saw someone swerve out to avoid some chunk of drywall that fell off someone s truck. very hard to see with the angle of the sun and the color of the material. if i was closer behind the vehicle ahead of me i might not have been able to avoid it and or there might be someone in either lane next to me where i d have to drive over it directly.
rollsroyce,,8,lmao at the first entry in that website when i searched it
bentley,,4,"i know, i m just saying that the v12 is like a status symbol statement that differs a rr from your average 7 series. it s like every piece in a rr, obviously people aren t just buying it for the v12, then they d get an aventador, but it s because it has a v12 and everyother part is different from your average car. what i mean is when ev comes, how do rr and those exotic brand make a statement out of that powertrain like they do with their exotic ice."
rollsroyce,,33,"there was a time, less than 10 years ago, where chevy was selling a new car sonic for 10,000. you could literally buy a brand new car, that you know hasn t been abused by previous owners, and had a power train warranty that would guarantee you so many thousand miles without paying repair bills, for a 4 digit price. unfortunately the margins weren t high enough for chevy, and the trend in general now is that way too many idiots are willing to take out 10 year loans on vehicles that cost 1.0 x their salary, and the margins are way higher on those vehicles. so bye bye to the affordable car with lower margins."
bentley,Bentley,18,"i m not personally interested in phevs but they make sense. commute on electricity, then bomb up the mountain for ski weekend on gas. if most of your driving is local then gas fill ups will be infrequent. 50 miles is likely more than enough for the typical bentley owner. if your wife would have to fill up every 3 days then it sounds like the electric commute gas road trip combination just doesn t work for the amount of driving she has to do."
ferrari,Ferrari,16,"yup. ferrari just wanted to race, but ford wanted ferrari for the race cars. so you can see why things went awry. pure speculation on my part but i doubt it was as simple as ford saying we want to buy your company and your racing program and ferrari saying sure, just not the racing program and then ford getting pissed. i suspect ferrari led ford on or balked at the last minute or something like that. the gt40 mk2 is the body style everyone knows and loves, but i think it s predecessor, the mk1 tried and failed miserably at le mans the two years prior. doesn t get a lot of coverage. off the heels of his success with the daytona coupe in the gt class, shelby, with the help of ken miles, and pete brock and bruce mclaren came in and straightened things out. the gt40 team as a whole was a legendary group names, personalities, and innovators the likes of which we may never see again. can you imagine if things went differently? i m not a huge ferrari guy, but they probably wouldn t be anywhere near where they are today had ford taken control. and although they already had an existing relationship, his work on the gt40 probably cemented shelby s ties to ford. and from that relationship we got the great gt40 and all it s historic and modern day successors, and all the great mustangs and stuff like that."
bentley,,4,most of the youtube car review videos i ve seen are of people who clearly don t know much about cars and are just reading shit from the manufacturer s website without actually understanding what they re saying. the extent of the mechanical review is popping the hood it has a v6 engine and that s really cool.... check out these cupholders and usb charger! the person is making car review videos in order to generate content to get views.... not because they re a car aficionado. it could be a shampoo review for all they care.

porsche,,8,would love to see it but i doubt ferrari would ever do it. based on the 296 lap the f80 should easily be into the 6 40s if not faster
porsche,,5,"this is pretty much what i went though, though a little less intense, when i bought my si and when i went to look at the 2018 accord. they do almost anything to keep you on the lot. hell, when i went with my wife to look at the highlander they were dicks about my credit and then didn t want to give me my keys back when i truthfully told them i had to go home and take heart medicine . with the si they kept making shit up or talking about crap i didn t care about. with the accord the guy actually left me alone because i was telling my wife the sales pitch. still you could tell he didn t want me to get away. i will most likely be using a car buying service for my next purchase. probably usaa s. it s not worth the nonsense."
lucid,,5,"as someone else already said, the wealthy are the best first adopters. perception is very important when marketing a new product. when car manufacturers first tried to offers small, economy evs in the 1970s in response to the oil crisis, the public saw them being actively purchased by broke granola hippies and stick it to the man counterculture folks, therefore the association was negative. now, car manufacturers develop and market evs as luxury vehicles, so the public perception has changed accordingly to see evs as something wealthy and successful people buy and associate them as something cool, futuristic, and aspirational."

tesla,,92,we need direct sales across the board what s the hold up??!
rollsroyce,,13,"my mk7 gti clubsport came with 19x7.5 wheels running 225 35 19 tyres. razor thin sidewall that failed on me twice before i ditched them for an 18 aftermarket wheel setup. said wheels are lighter too so the car feels a little bit more eager to dance. most importantly though, it s all around more settled. you can still feel it moving around and wandering a little bit on road imperfections and camber changes, but in a far less crashy fashion now that it s got some semblance of sidewall. the bumps get soaked up rather than bouncing the whole car around. afaik the mk8 gti stock fitment would probably be 18x7.5 with 225 40 section tyres. they usually give the rs the 8 wide wheels that necessitate the 235mm tread width, which the special edition gtis occasionally get. like the upcoming gti edition 50 and the forged warmenau wheels that debuted with the r facelift. eta apparently the adelaide wheels offered for the regular mk8 gti were also 19x8 , with the 235 35s. but the richmond style wheels were the typical 18x7.5 setup with 225 40s. maybe the mk8 s improved dcc handles the 19s better than my old mk7 but the idea still doesn t sit right with me. rubber band sidewalls are silly."
tesla,,20,"the whole idea was that the times you read about the magazines timing wheel would be relatable to what the average guy would get if he took his car to the drag strip timing light beam and rollout factor . nothing about the timing wheel needed a rollout. but back then customers did not have access to a timing wheel style measurement, the only thing the average joe could use is a dragstrip. beam lights at the finish stop the timer at a dragstrip. it s a single beam light though so the rollout issue isn t a factor. trap speed is somewhat more complicated, but that s another discussion."
bentley,,209,"so the profit margins on these vehicles are huge. in other words, you re paying for the name and not the cost quality of production."
rollsroyce,,20,"airport lots have very good cameras and atl lots have plenty. they ll know exactly what space your car was in and when it entered and when it left. whether or not they ll share footage with you is a different question. so long as someone is willing to pay the ticket, they aren t checking who is leaving with a car. i once lost my car out in the economy lot and asked for help after spending an hour walking around and the officer got a location by simply calling in my tag. this was also 15 years ago and the tech has gotten better. i used to drive and park on occasion if i had a day trip but atl lots are undergoing construction right now meaning west lot rental car train. few things are more stressful than being a few minutes late and desperately trying to find a parking space of any kind. uber just takes out a lot of steps and doesn t cost that much more."

bentley,,24,"people who haven t driven them seriously just don t understand how fucking fast they are, even up into the triple digit mph range, they keep pulling. my jag and tuned e92 aren t the fastest cars, but they re pretty damn quick. after driving the tesla for a bit, though, they feel outright slow . and like you said, the lack of launch control and perfect traction is just incredible. no settings to fiddle with, no preparation, no tire squeal, no wiggling or squirreliness just stomp the pedal and all the power is immediately used to send you perfectly straight and forward with no drama."
rollsroyce,,12,"if you have instagram, you didn t actually delete facebook. fb still keeps the profile of you on their servers and updates the information as you update instagram. if you deleted your profile in 2009 but resigned up for fb again right now, you would see all of your old friends still on your friend s list, updated phone numbers, etc. this is despite your account being completely new from your perspective. it s because fb never deleted it. they kept it on their servers for if when you come back. furthermore, even if you never had fb, instagram, whatsapp, etc accounts literally never signed up for any of them at all , fb still knows your name, phone number, email address, home address, etc etc. this is because their apps source these data points from phones, so if one of your friends has the fb app installed on their phone, fb can get all of your info from that."
bentley,,4,that s a terrible name. it makes me think of shoddy rides and clowns.
tesla,Model S,-8,what you mean is you can t afford any of the them.
lucid,,51,"you re going to have to pry the keys to my 6mt pro4x d40 frontier and xterra from my cold, dead hands. they are quintessential definition of what a hardcore truck or suv should be. and they were sold up to 2020 2015 so there s still clean examples of them around. sadly, the new d41 frontier while capable and what modern consumers want just isn t for me. they truly were the last of a breed. the trd tacoma is very similar in feel to the old d40, has a more capable engine and more modern interior, but the prices are absolutely insane. they also aren t as easy to mod and are much more expensive to repair and off road vehicles get pretty beat on ."
bentley,,4,"ya definitely good to see. i feel like when people like us say we re tired of everything being integrated into infotainment people just think we re being crotchety or old. it s not that i have a problem with screens and infotainment. i m fine with the new tech, but if some old ways knobs are better for some actions ac i don t want it in the screen. is it awesome to be able to adjust the eq to exactly what you want? ya, but i don t need to go thru three menus to turn on seat warmers."
lucid,,9,"yes, but most of the legacy auto manufacturers have spent the last decade not adapting to evs but rather, undermining the shift to evs, by way of messaging, phony market research, and lobbying. this undermining has been in lieu of developing the production capacity necessary to deliver evs in high enough quantities to satisfy demand. only very recently have they conceded that tactic is not viable and shifted resources to building ev capacity. the reluctance to change cannot be understated. compounding this was a widespread belief held by fans of incumbent manufacturers that when they were ready to do so, a shift to evs would be nearly effortless. like flipping a switch. perhaps that narrative was carefully seeded by the manufacturers themselves i am not sure. but in any case, the narrative was a lie. so we have a scenario where the ev manufacturer with the largest production capacity is a fairly new company that is still building that capacity via new factories, tesla. eventually we may see legacy manufacturers able to produce evs at a volume sufficient to meet demand, but that s at least many years off still. so although the technology has been around for decades, the will to do something about it has been largely absent."
bentley,,12,"i m certain there was a minimum weight target for that car i do all my own work and i ve been through it completely, and there is no attempt at weight savings whatsoever. the acceleration feeling is really unique and what i love most about the car. it s not really quick by modern standards 0 60 in 5.9 seconds but full throttle feels like an airliner taking off when it s lightly loaded you feel it in your chest and seat more than your neck. another maybe less helpful metaphor is that it feels like pinning the throttle in a 2000hp, 60 motoryacht it doesn t pickup really fast but the sensation of power is immense."
porsche,,13,"by 1960s standards it was reliable and cheap to run. the transmissions in particular were and are still very solid, which is the topic here."
bentley,,9,"i can totally relate. when i was a little girl in panama, a rich american came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. i said to him, what do you call this most beautiful fabric? , and he said they call it cashmere . i repeated the words cashmere, cashmere . i asked if i could have it, and he said no. get away from me. then he started walk away. but i grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. and then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. oh, but i didn t want the change. i wanted the cashmere."
bentley,Bentley,7,this post and discussion are proudly sponsored by bentley.
lucid,,29,"electric motors are basically the same efficiency when generating the same power even if one motor can make more peak power than another. it takes about 50 hp to do highway speeds, so whether the motor can do 400 or 800 peak doesn t matter when it s only being used for 50 on the highway. it s all about battery size. if it takes 20 kw to do 70 mph and an ev has a 100 kwh battery, it could do 70 mph for 5 hours 20 kw needed over 5 hours, so 100 kwh , meaning 350 miles of driving. that 20 kw can be generated by a 200 or 400 kw motor, either way only 20 kw would be needed."
ferrari,,134,"have you driven one? that s half of the appeal. you don t buy a hellcat to do magazine skidpad tests or 0 60 runs. you buy one because you want a true muscle car that turns heads, has that supercharger whine that makes you smile every time you drive, is comfortable as hell, and eats up highway on ramps. it s a car that s an amazing daily driver while having the ability to be very, very fast from a roll while sounding badass. for a sub that always talks about driving experience being more important than numbers, the hellcat is exactly that. it s a driving experience and the only number that matters is smiles per gallon. as confusing as it may be to people, i cross shopped my tesla against a hellcat challenger and used to daily an srt challenger."
lucid,Lucid,15,"thanks for the write up, it looks like you re more intune with the automotive market than even folks at autoline network from the shots of you in the rear passenger seats of the s class, it doesn t look like neither tesla or lucid could match mercedes when it comes the luxury of being chauffeured. the model s plaid and lucid air dream edition looks to be great driver s luxury car, however isn t as refined being if you re a rear or front passenger. i doubt captain chairs is a possible option for them, or even a consideration. i made such comments as in some markets like south east asia, buyers look towards the passenger experience more than being a driver."
lucid,,6,as an ev driver of 8 years i would never want a hydrogen powered car. people tend to complain about charging times of evs. but i save far more time being able to fuel at home then i lose charging when i am driving long distance. so for me an ev is much more practical then a car i can t fuel at home. plus there have been many takedowns of this. hydrogen doesn t avoid the chip problem as they will still need chips to build them. and fuel cell cars also have batteries although smaller then a bev. plus at the current time hydrogen is very expensive. and then finally the efficiency of creating hydrogen is pretty terrible. so you are much better off to charge a battery pack directly with the electricity. in the end i don t think hydrogen will be a fuel used for small vehciles. it might see more use in larger ones though.
rollsroyce,,10,i guess i still don t understand why is relaxing the main priority. you re doing something that is statistically the most dangerous thing you likely do regularly. a moment of inattention combined with a little bad luck could kill you or someone else. a little visual clutter to ensure that the majority of drivers can access the controls they need without a lot of effort or needing to look away from the road seems like a worthwhile tradeoff.

rollsroyce,,8,"i bought a 07 s6 last year for 4k, knowing that it needed a lot of work. since then i ve done a lot of research and a lot of repairs. the 5.2l v10 in the s6 and the 5.2l v10 in the lamborghini r8 are actually not the same engine. they are both 5.2l v10 s, but that s about where the similarities end. omakayd posted a picture of the two engines side by side on his instagram a while ago i thought i took a screenshot, but can t seem to find it. i ll see if he ll send it to me . the engine in the s6 is actually based on the 4.2l v8 that audi makes, with a few extra cylinders the engine in the rs6 i believe is then based on this upsized 5.2, and then scaled down to 5.0, to help fit the turbos, both physically and for combustion performance whereas the engine in the lambo r8 are completely different. that all said, the engine in the s6 is not really unreliable. it s got its share of electrical gremlins it is german, after all , many of its seals tend to turn brittle over time, but the engine really is pretty damn bulletproof. people like that they can buy a fast fun car for cheap, but don t realize that it still has high end maintenance prices, neglect the maintenance, and then get upset when it has issues. side note i love your taste in cars."
rollsroyce,,19,"yeah, i ll try to post one on here today! thanks for reading and for the suggestion."
porsche,,76,the civic si is known for being anemic at this point. the wrangler has a lot more power despite being so much bigger.
lucid,,3,"so i guess i m an enthusiast . i have two evs myp ioniq5 and a track car supercharged brz . my brz makes some sweet noises. and my two evs have their own distinctive sounds that are also pleasant to me. agree with your other points. the whataboutism is so insane with respect to evs. the best thing for the planet is if we all stopped owning personal vehicles and reduced personal travel to a minimum. my evs are both faster in a straight line than my track car but you can guess which one puts down better lap times. but that s fine, they re different vehicles for different purposes and i recognize them as such."
tesla,Model S,1,once you go ev it s hard to go back to ice. it s not a tesla thing. one find i did find is that once i went tesla i found it hard to go back to cars that are dumb. my friend needed an ota and he had to go to dealer to update it. an ota!
lucid,,58,"is it just me... or is it wildly frustrating that ev range is always portrayed by comparing the distance of two ca locations? that s enough to get from san fran to san diego means nothing to most of the country. and, to be honest, it doesn t even seem all that impressive as it s in one state. that s enough to get from new york city to raleigh, nc? seems 10x more impressive and most could at least picture the distance between ny and nc."
porsche,,3,"the mach e is a good car, it drives pretty well despite the weight and it looks nice. but it was made as an experiment for ford to figure out how an ev should be made, not really as a car to sell long term. it falls short versus a model y in every objective measure, which is why the sales are what they are, but ford will be unveiling their actual competitive ev on august 11th, which will give a better idea of where they are."
tesla,Model S,5,you d be surprised. check out the cx5 sub and it s almost like the cx5 handles like a ferrari or some shit.
ferrari,,53,"hahaha, when i was editing it, i was thinking people are going to make fun of me for this. but if you re like me, you think a 30 year old italian car is put together kind of questionably, and i was just shocked at how it didn t feel like that. i think it needed repeating everyone talks about the turbo lag and the lowness and the tight seats, but that s one thing i haven t heard in many reviews just how stable it feels."

lucid,,13,
tesla,,3,yeah look at all these idiots who use aircon in a different way than you guys haha what losers
bentley,,3,"to your point in your other comment, did you find that it felt like you were walking them the whole time, because their capabilities are so much higher than what you can reasonably do on the road? i found that to be the case even with the 370z. i drove a stick with ps4 s tires and felt it would go way too fast too easily. it was very capable , but its limits were so much higher than a regular car that driving at anything near legal speeds didn t feel like anything at all. it felt extremely planted, smooth, and isolated... and boring at anything under 100kph."
porsche,,9,"i never said you should hoard every penny. when it comes to cars, it s about trying to hoard a few tens of thousands dollars more. as a person who s growing into his 30s with wealthy friends, i can say that cars alone definitely don t bring you happiness. neither does a 2m house. the community, the friends and what you do with your car brings you real happiness. you may enjoy the extra pizazz, horsepower and tightness of a brand new m3 over a used one, but the extra 60k you re spending up front and the extra 40k you ll lose relative to the older m3 in depreciation in the next 4 years can buy you a lot of experiences, lessons, life value that can be in particular leveraged and enjoyed while you are still young. an extra 10 20k saved and used on travel not necessarily extravagant , language learning, sports coaching, cooking lessons, a nice bicycle, skiing lessons and passes in your 20s and 30s is enormously more useful, and imo fun compared to owning a brand new well specced m3 over an e90 m3. that being said, if the choice is between a 25k new civic and a 30k c6 corvette, you re not really being nearly as irresponsible by picking the corvette. i d pick the vette any day"
lucid,,5,"still expanding, and they def need more publicity. the new gravity could be a game changer"
bentley,,5,he s talked about the house thing openly the venice house was his dad s and then he moved and bought his own house. he claims his dad no longer supports him financially. other than having given him some investment capital for wccs.
tesla,Model S,4,"that s where this review goes wrong for me. no one has ever bought a forester for driving dynamics but they do buy it for ease of use like visibility making it easy to drive esp. people switching between sedans and cuvs . the touchscreen was the exact reason i chose a civic over an impreza. it was so cumbersome even on the test drive. too much crammed onto the screen, too many colors and lines on top of just being gross aesthetically."
bentley,,16,"this is pretty spot on. the truth is you cannot bend physics and speaker locations in a car are pretty bad, even in the best cases when the car has been engineered with speaker placement and vibrations in mind. to compensate for this, you pretty much need software compensation that s specifically tailored to the car in question. you could do this with an aftermarket audio system, but it d require a very significant investment and a lot of fine tuning. u savagegeese does analysis on sound systems in most of his more recent videos"
lucid,,3,"tldr i have been loving it so far. long version bmws are better tech wise, but audi has a more traditional and tactile interior. some things that i expected the audi to have as even my civic has them are missing though like walk away auto lock, remote start. the safety systems lane keep and stuff are better in the civic too. the tablet screen doesn t bug me too much. it is out of the way and really responsive. i do think the s5 looks sightly better or at least more distinctive than the m340i. the m440i and s4 are not as good looking though. the liftback is a big pro for the s5. it is fast enough for me, and looks like its fairly reliable from my research. mine also has a factory exhaust resonator so it sounds pretty good too. i found the s5 more comfortable too. the bmw seats just didn t fit me very well and i found it nearly impossible to find one with adaptive suspension and adaptive cruise control"
bentley,,4,"i never liked chanel myself, but their tweed skirt suit became the look for east coast old money. emily gilmore in gilmore girls was a perfect representation of that. their leather felt better than their competitors iirc but i can t remember the fabrics. they definitely milked the logo on bags and shoes i m having flashbacks to the ballet flats. demna i learned to appreciate. his look still isn t what i d gravitate toward, but i like that he s doing it and finally getting some positive press for moving menswear out of its near 20 year sameness. i m curious about dukec at rolls. there s not much freedom to change the look so i m interested in how he ll interpret that challenge."
ferrari,,5,"even that is a bit of a stretch because ultimately cars out of the gt division are just modifications of the pedestrian cars. the gt4 gt3 rs gt2 rs are all just upgraded versions of the base cars. highly upgraded sure, but not really unique in the same way as the carrera gt or 918 spyder. that said, i think even as a non exotic marquee porsche manages to carry almost as much brand prestige as the true exotics as a result of their single minded dedication to motorsports. it s almost impossible to separate the two."
lucid,Lucid,3,i assume someone driving a lucid sapphire isn t someone who has to drive to their normal office job regularly
bentley,Bentley,4,"i think one interesting thing is regardless of how you feel about the concept, even if you are not interested in owning a bentley, they offer a way to provide feedback"
rollsroyce,,9,
lucid,,63,"hipsters cosplaying outdoorsmen want the spartan truck experience as a second vehicle used from the factory, of course . literally nobody who has ever daily driven a truck for any reason has said boy, these power windows and extra seats sure are cumbersome. give me back my crank windows and make it a single cab! and these same people think that people who actually buy pickups should just get a ridgeline instead, despite not being particularly cheap or fuel efficient compared to a half ton, they just want the smooth ride and smallish footprint."
lucid,,33,"this is a completely delusional statement. rivian just turned their first profit. cadillac and buick backtracked on their ev goals before the administration change. i m sure you won t attack france for the slowing of tesla sales. this is about a single company, not an industry. we re still seeing plenty of other companies investments in evs continue. we just got a post about an impending ev announcement from toyota. and, of course, this anything related to policy isn t killing and industry. it s still the auto industry. i m sure you weren t looking at ev mandates and lamenting they re killing the ice industry, 2 years ago. you re just looking for a low iq argument to make things political."
tesla,,32,modern grifting just says the unspoken parts out loud now.
tesla,Model S,3,"agreed, to an extent. all luxury cars depreciate a lot. the evs are a bit worse, but the rs e tron is probably the worst of them all. i m already seeing used ones going for like 60 70k after starting at freaking 160k."
