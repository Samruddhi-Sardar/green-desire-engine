bentley,,31,litrerally no one whose shopping for those caliber of cars knows the xb7 exists.
porsche,,3,"you d still be able to accelerate faster than 99 of american traffic, in my experience. my last car was an 08 sx 4 with a 5 speed that did 0 60 in 8.5 or something and i was still constantly annoyed by people piddling around in cars much faster than mine."
lucid,,8,"hopefully i m that guy haha. i ve got a 2021 dodge charger though, so according to op i am abnormal which, maybe i am, who knows? i love vehicles of all shapes and sizes, and i love the stories behind them. i love many of the stories and background facts around mopars. i love fact dropping that my charger is based on an old mercedes e class platform. i do it because i think it s cool that dodge took the leftovers from mercedes when they left them for dead and turned them into some of the wildest machines ever made and i jokingly say i drive a mercedes haha . but i agree that many mopar people are nuts. i get crapped on by many of them for driving one with the v6. i love the v6 it s the 3.6l pentastar that almost single handedly improved numerous chrysler offerings in one year when the fiat merger happened. it s incredibly smooth, reasonably powerful, and gets decent fuel economy. but because it ain t got a hemi , it gets dismissed. i actually consider going back to a mustang because i hate this so much and people think i m some menace on the roads when i m just minding my own business . i love the hemi v8 and i m sad to see it go. i grew up in a mopar family with ram trucks, dodges, and jeeps. unlike the crazy mopar freaks, i am extremely excited for the new electric charger and i m hoping that the hurricane i 6 will also show up in that car. i m a big fan of progress by improving performance and lessening the impact on our planet. what s so bad about that? sure i ll miss the v8 sound but if we cling to the past, we won t get a better tomorrow cheesy as that sounds. so yeah, take what you will from a reasonable mopar enthusiast."
lucid,,9,"car culture and certain people s enthusiasm for cars will completely die out at some point because the direction of modern car design is heading towards a very boring, generic and soulless route. in the past, cars appeared much more colourful and distinctive with their unique designs and more mechanical feel which felt much more raw and exciting to most car enthusiasts. but in recent times, cars have mostly gone from having a fun appeal to becoming characterless, colourless and soulless. they ve become more digital, more electric and less distinctive. now of course, most people probably don t care about cars and never cared they just buy out of necessity and want to get from point a to point b. which is absolutely fine and car companies have to appeal to those people because those cars will sell, out of necessity. but what s in it for the car enthusiast? probably even the very richest people who have a deep passion and knowledge for cars would prefer to buy an expensive car that is more than 10 years old to get that excitement loud engine noises, a mechanical, raw connection with their car, and actual buttons and levers that click rather than big ugly touchscreens. and something that doesn t look so bloated or generic. the average car enthusiast would also probably prefer to buy something older from the used market that feels exciting to look at, to use, to drive, to listen to. but then i suppose it s a question of how long you d be able to drive it before you are forced to get something new and boring."
porsche,,6,"good point. they can make up their domestic losses in greece, right? c mon man"
tesla,,10,"i d say shut up and just launch the car, but their entire stock is based on the executives spewing fairy tales every few months"

porsche,,70,"do you want to pay obscene money for a walking ego to cut up your car with a reciprocating saw and put crappy overfenders on it? this guy has his team bring a fucking throne with them when he goes to install these kits so he can sit on it during his many smoke breaks. watch a video of him installing one of his kits. totally ignoring how ugly they are, they arent anything special. its on the same level as those chrome liberty walk gtrs you see all over instagram"
lucid,,8,"when i see commuter cars accomplish feats of 0 60 speeds like this, it leaves me wondering, where do we go from here? i m sure the same was said decades ago with sub 5 second 0 60s. at this point we might as well teleport to avoid snapping our necks for those of us who aren t f1 driver fit."
rollsroyce,,3,"he still doesn t make third string for jackass. i m not saying i watch highbrow content, but i can t watch this dude s content."
porsche,,9,"their company failed. they should ve went to the ground and checked out rural towns and bigger cities instead of their office. i do uber from time to time and people are scared to get electric car due to range anxiety. some are getting scared for no reason but at the same time you lose 40 right out of the bat for an electric car, you don t want to charge over 80 and can t go less than 20 to conserve the battery. america loves engines, regardless of how illogical it is. maybe toyota knows the common people because they did it right."
bentley,,7,"that s a gt3 rs though. the other is a family car. like don t get me wrong it s a brilliant car and given the choice i d take a gt3 rs any day over whichever ev. but the point is that as a daily an ev is just so effortless and easy that any ice car will feel like going back to the stone age. the one pedal driving, instant response, damn near total quiet, no vibrations etc all add up to a super comfortable and relaxing driving experience you can t even match with an s class or whatever. coincidentally though that is what makes evs boring. yeah they re great as a daily and i d take one in a heartbeat. but the quick acceleration gets meh after some time and because the car is so perfect it lacks character. my 115hp e46 i used to own was a complete shitbox. i ve driven much more powerful cars which were supposedly more fun. but i still miss the e46 because it s shitness and low power made it incredibly fun to throw around alpine roads, because it was a challenge. it had character."
tesla,Tesla,19,"it s a very bad look for someone to discover this, but if it s an adequate substitute for the original part which isn t intended to be user serviceable it s not really a problem in any mechanical sense. making this call shows a certain level of adaptivity which imo is a net positive for the company. you might as well complain what color zip ties get used for a cable harness. lol these people smoke too much electrek teslarati"

bentley,Bentayga,39,"i own an exotic brokerage, i have owned just about everything and consult others on their purchases. ill tell you exactly why from my perspective combined with what i ve heard from prospective buyers outside of anyone s personal preferences, its pretty much the only ultra lux suv that makes any sense to own for wanting a full size suv of that caliber. comparing the exotic manufacturers urus despite being basically a bentayga underneath with dumb looks, it has less interior room and less engine options dbx only real competitor, but has off putting aesthetics and mainly people are still untrusting of am reliability purosangue basically a cuv and almost twice the price cullinan more than twice the price now to the non exotic manufacturers for if you don t care about the badge g63 drives like ass in comparison and is almost the exact same price gls600 maybach its really just a trim option on a basic vehicle, gone are the days of the maybach moniker meaning anything, also costs the same range rover autobiography doesn t have the interior to match, also doesnt differentiate itself from the standard ranges at less than half the cost"
porsche,,14,"actually, i don t think wealth like that follows a linear path. most millionaires do drive late model sedans in the 30k 50k range. a million isn t that much money nowadays. especially the way the people in pf see it. for them, the end game is to be able to retire on that money. so, 1 million at a 4 withdrawal rate is only 40k a year. how many people driving lambos make 40k a year? the issue is that a large percentage of people that live the luxury lifestyle are income rich and cash poor. maybe you have an investment banker making 1 million a year but spending most of that on a mortgage, car payments, clothes shopping, etc. if they lose their job, that car is getting repo d, the house is getting foreclosed on, etc. to someone in pf, a millionaire has a million in a bank or brokerage. if they lose their job, the car is probably paid for. the million will float their mortgage payments if the house isn t already paid off. someone on pf would only be buying a lamborghini when their net worth increased to such a level that their investments were throwing off so much income that they could afford to splurge."
porsche,,3,the car was 65k in 93 my goodness y all are delusional
bentley,,34,"yup. i m so goddamn sick of journalists who will go into excruciating detail about a car and compare every single but and bolt to it s competitor, and then say well they re both great cars! we can t say which one in better! we literally can t say any opinion at all or add any useful information outside of the specs sheet and talking points the manufacturer gave us! and that s how you end up with 500 videos on youtube about the exact same car on launch day, all saying the exact same useless information. 90 of auto journalism is just a waste of bandwidth."
ferrari,,8,you d have to just once pay to get it shipped to a giant airfield of some sort and just give it a go. like a massive open space where you can t really crash it into anything. imagine owning an f40 and never driving it. it would be physically painful.
ferrari,,27,this is the mother of all pyramid schemes
rollsroyce,,3,"i have a 96 xj12, and i second this. jaguar s documentation when it came to switching parts in the middle of the production run was not good. beside that, a lot of the parts are nla and either have to be sourced used, or rebuilt. my radiator is good, but i m praying that my water pump doesn t fail. my steering, whose rack has already been rebuilt twice, is also leaking again it recently dumped dexron iii all over my driveway. i m hoping it s just a line."
porsche,,6,"dashcams were deemed illegal in sweden a few years ago because they were said to be permanently installed security cameras, and you need a permission to have those. this was changed in 2016 though, so now they re deemed legal. it s never been illegal to take pictures of others in public though, it the permanently installed part that was illegal. trail cameras need permission too for the same reason, personal integrity, even if they re installed deep in the woods."

tesla,Model S,27,"hey guys, no one buy any of their cars, until they sell a bunch of cars.... read back what you wrote and explain how that works."
porsche,,80,"i feel like all german manufacturers also shoot themselves in the leg with overengineering some things. like interior on new gen cars is abysmal. i was so glad that vw got rid of the stupid capacitive touch buttons on steering wheel and then audi puts them in. they also need 3 screens and one of them has to ideally stick out and be the size of ipad pro. just new features for the sake of new features, quality going down and price going up. and the whole hierarchy in vw where one brand can t be better then the other is just tiring."
porsche,,4,i would not have been able to make it work as my only car. it s too small and i didn t find it very comfortable. mazda s infotainment is straight up garbage too.
ferrari,,3,"i don t think the op ever said he wasn t lucky. i m a couple of income brackets above him, and i consider myself lucky as hell, because i m well aware that my success is due largely to being in the right place at the right time. but, knowing that, it s just as shitty for observers to pretend like all it takes is luck, by place or by birth. gaining real wealth takes both the luck to get an opportunity, and the hard work to take advantage of it. there was a period of 3 years over the last half decade where i literally worked seven days a week, 14 hours a day. out of 1095 days, i maybe took three weeks off sick days, holidays, and family vacations with my daughter . and when people come in and say things like oh you didn t earn what you have, someone gave it to you or you just got lucky , it s infuriating. how about we all just try to not be dicks to each other and stop judging people on how much it how little they have, and stop making assumptions about how we all got to where we are?"
porsche,,253,"no skoda in north america edit available in mexico maybe, but can t import."
lucid,,14,i live in norway and i ve never seen one.
ferrari,,7,no. c7 zr1 has 755hp and i daily drove a manual 650hp zl1 for years. no problem at all.
tesla,,36,i mean you re also talking about a genuine luxury vehicle vs what is ostensibly a fast appliance car. fair game if that s not worth 20k to you or other buyers but they re very different propositions.
ferrari,,7,"hey man, it s the best they could do. turns out one of their princes is actually an auto designer and funds have been really lacking for some reason."
porsche,Porsche,5,"i did....after a lifetime 25 yrs of driving manuals. integra gs r 5sp, honda s2000, cayman s 6mt. after decades, shifting isn t something you even think about it s like blinking your eyes, it just kind of happens on its own. i came across a great deal on my current 911, and it just happened to be spec d with a pdk. it is an amazing piece of tech. so for the first time in my life, i don t have a stick in the garage. to be honest, i haven t missed the manual like i thought i might. fwiw, the s2000 gearbox was better than any porsche i have driven. direct action, short throws..."
lucid,,4,"the jesko is properly fast around a track. wasn t even going all out driving wise, was down 400hp due not using e85, and they weren t even trying to set a record and it still beat the gt3 mr by 7 seconds. on top of that even their slow cars like the ccx are still quite fast. even if it just handles alright that paired with 2300hp is going to allow it to smash any other 4 seater on a track provided it isn t a autocross course. power isn t everything but 2300hp is 2300hp."
porsche,,7,
bentley,,3,"that s what they said for the new ghost. i wish it were possible to experience it because i m very curious about that claim. in any case, the spectre is probably at least as quiet as the production spec ghost. edmunds testing"
rollsroyce,,4,"this is vwvortex now, for me. there s activity but it s so sparse compared to what it was. without the content of the old mk2 classifieds and how abundant they were, i don t even want to try and own another. the newer sub forums are a little more active but still nothing compared to 20 years ago. one page covers like a week of content. that would have been an hour of content back in the day. vwroc is better but not many from na it seems."
ferrari,,27,hahahaha lol the honda kids. if i showed you my car you d feel better. 1971 beetle rolling chassis. at least yours run lol in my eyes you guys are miata gang. i m a miata guy at heart. my brother had one but i can t afford one. i live in mexico and we only had the nc and nd. used nds are as expensive as a new one. ncs are usually automatic you guys are the weird miata cousins. of only we had a new mr2. think the same philosophy as the nd but mid engine. similarly priced. that car would sell.
bentley,,7,looks like u9 and potentially the mg are the only currently mass produced ones on that list. first i m hearing of either though. not sure if maserati folgere is out but it starts at 200k so i can t imagine they re expecting to sell any. i guess the jag will be the first non chinese 2 door sports bev expected to sell more than a few thousand units.
lucid,,58,"i always think that kei mini trucks are overly glorified by american car enthusiasts. i understand why y all like them, they are the antithesis of big american pickup trucks, compact, utilitarian, and actually used for work and of course, because they are forbidden fruits, never sold in america. i understand why you want them, maybe for a farm truck, driving around the property, or if you live in the city as a daily commuter car. but trust me, as someone who actually drives daihatsu hijet and suzuki carry a lot for work, they are crap. people or businesses that own these pick up trucks are forced to own them because they can only afford them or because it s not feasible financially to get better trucks. i think you already know that they are slow, barely keeping up with the traffic, and struggling when going uphill, especially with stuffs on the bed. they are uncomfortable, the seats are uncomfortable, and you can t adjust them. they are built for short people, you can t adjust the position of the pedals. the suspensions are uncomfortably hard. it barely has noise insulation, you can t hear the music or talk to your passenger when you drive. driving them on the motorway is scary, they are short and tall with thin tyres, bad combination. it feels like a wind can flip your car, or if you make a turn or lane change, it will flip. getting a hilux is a huge upgrade for me. i like small pickup trucks too. i think the hilux is a gas guzzler, too big, and too luxurious . man, i wish they made a smaller, body on frame pickup truck, maybe ford maverick sized, but with a regular cab and body on frame."
ferrari,,118,"weather. always weather. i had a bmw z8 lined up in florida months ago and it rained and i couldn t shoot it. i ve already cancelled six videos this year due to snow ice rain. weather is my greatest annoyance, because scheduling is hell you re not only dealing with your schedule, but also the car owner, the car owner for the next day and the prior day i can t do friday means you move the guy who was on friday to saturday, etc , and your own youtube schedule of can t do too many bmws at once or need this new car to come out first or whatever. then you get through all that and ... it rains."
ferrari,,3,"nobody really cared when they came out surprisingly. the testarossa was a response to the countache, they did another mid engine v12 with the 512 and then stopped because they were just better at doing their own thing rather than chasing lambo."
rollsroyce,,14,"i ll freely admit that i m a luddite when it comes to cars. i know it will get harder and harder to find, but i don t want a car that gets ota updates. ota updates are for gadgets that get replaced frequently, like phones. the possibility of getting in my car one morning, to find out that an update changed the ui while i was sleeping, is just not something i want to deal with. it s basically theft, in a way. they can take away what you paid for without your consent or knowledge, and replace it with something else."
bentley,,4,that s a terrible name. it makes me think of shoddy rides and clowns.
tesla,Model S,41,hopefully they don t charge 250k for this
tesla,Tesla,56,"even with all the power in the world, a model s isn t going to beat a porsche around a track. porsche has been designing and testing cars on the nurburgring for a long time. elon just decided sometime in the past week that it would be nice if a tesla could go around the nurburgring. the suspension and chassis of the model s will hold it back from beating porsche, even if they get their drivetrain up to snuff. and who s to say the roadster drivetrain doesn t have the exact same issues anyways?"
lucid,,19,come might say it s a crossover between a minivan and suv.
porsche,Porsche,40,this could have been avoided if the m2 driver didn t pull to the right on a corner where you stay left middle leading the porsche driver think m2 is letting them pass. this could have also been avoided if the bmw driver used their mirrors. this could have ofc also been avoided if the porsche driver drove extra safe. i disagree about the patient part. i think the porsche driver is definitely patient. didn t try anything until bmw give him space and then bmw decides to take the space back cutting into a corner you don t even need to cut in for. edit misha agrees with me apparently youtube
rollsroyce,,6,"depends on the car, i test drove one with a touch screen and bought one a year older before they put touch screens in them i think . and honestly personally i don t care as 1 the fuckin thing is so far away i can t reach it anyway and i m 6 4 and 2 the idrive controls actually work really well. personal preference. i would rather have physical buttons for everything anyway. but i m sure some people may look at some cars and not like that they don t get a touchscreen."
rollsroyce,,5,"well i didn t expect you to double down on it. the only thing i lost points on during my drivers test okay, it was 22 years ago was for not checking over my shoulder during a lane change. even though i knew there was nothing there. still a good idea to do a quick glance, and let your periphery pick anything up, even with mirrors adjusted correctly per sae."
bentley,,6,"makes sense, they already make a car to rival the top range rovers lwb and maybach glss might as well make a car to be above the range rover sport and top trim gles but below the abovementioned cars. it s a good market to try and move into but you don t want to go too far downmarket and end up pulling a cadillac cetera jaguar x type problem"
ferrari,,12,mine acts up every few months and spits out some carbon looking stuff i gotta throw back in. still 8 10
rollsroyce,,12,"false. that is a huge component, but not the only component. it s a multi faceted mistake to make this generalization. you can just as easily, and more correctly, say all traffic is because of other people because no people means no traffic and retains validity independent of reaction time. when we incentivize shrewd safety over agency we get more traffic. when we punish fast drivers but not bad drivers we get more traffic. when we slow to see an accident we get more traffic. when we use cruise control we have more traffic. when we stuff millions of people through narrow corridors that stop end to end because 1 vehicle has an issue we have more traffic. when we have an inequality of destination we have more traffic. when we have a speed limit we have more traffic. when we have more or less or wider or bendier or rougher or wetter or darker or pretty much anything we will have more traffic. when we have better education, vehicles, standards, and supporting laws creating better more capable drivers we will have less traffic."
lucid,,27,they re not talking about cracks. they re talking about chips. you fill them in for cents on the dollar and send the car on to the next customer.
ferrari,Ferrari,3,"i love doug, his entertainment value for his audience shows in his success. but this really only applies to newer cars. except for maybe the supercar models, anything older than an f12 458 is actually preferred to be serviced by an independent because the typical independent mechanic worked at the ferrari dealer when many of those cars were new, so they know them better than most people at the dealer and the new old fcars are vastly different with their quirks ."
tesla,,3,"you have to think about the target audience. who watches reads car reviews? car enthusiasts. of course they have to nitpick about things while waxing lyrical about irrelevance such as the manual gearbox. otherwise, who would actually view the reviews. normal people just go out and actually buy a vehicle after a test drive. also, so many people here make comments about cars that just show their total disconnect from the real world. such as the post from a few days ago about a lamborghini urus being just a fancier q8. such shallow comments simply come from people that have neither been in a q8, nor a urus. a person of wealth that can afford a 400k car absolutely knows what is luxury and what isn t. car reviews can t tell you how the interior leather feels or how the audio system is."
tesla,Model 3,14,"i m not sure how it is when driving the model 3 but i had a mk1 yaris that had the speedo in the middle on top of the dashboard and it didn t take much to get used to or back from, you just learn to glance in a different position. a bunch of different cars have speedo s away from the traditional instrument cluster and nobody really complains about them. i get all the other issues with the model 3 s screen but i don t think the speedo being oddly positioned is really one of them."
rollsroyce,Phantom,3,"honestly, no car is perfect including teslas. however i think the tesla ui is still really good especially when compared. the ui in my audi honda ford is not great and i have to hunt and peck and search just do anything. adaptive cruise control and in the audi and honda are signficantly more dangerious than teslas by a long shot and they also suffer from phantom breaking. my audi s phantom breaking was very bad. i think you have some great points and i think it could use improvement. one of the good things and sometimes bad things about this car is that fixes actually make it to the car and the feature set in general continues to grow."
bentley,,4,"you are absolutely correct but there s a reason these type of subs all have a circlejerk parody subreddit. sports cars outside of their intended environment are stupid. there s a reason nearly every review platform for legacy media or tubers is centralized around californias canyon roads. that s not most people. i d be inclined to agree that most people outside of canyon road type environments are going to have more accessible, less compromised fun in a souped up pickup or suv vs. a full fledged sports car. i ll take my hopped up, lowered f 150 over most vehicles but i d sell my kidney for a golf r wagon if they brought em into canada."
lucid,,11,just wonder their sales in europe. they should have some sales there.
tesla,Model S,0,"hot take speed limits need to be increased or out right removed in some highways, cars are much safer for higher speeds now, and the autobahn proves you can have a safe highway where you can go as fast as you want."
tesla,,5,"he s saying that its no secret how they ve been able to acheive these feats, and its simply by throwing money and man power at it what western countries cant afford to do, he then questions whether or not it can be sustainable to which their real estate market was unable to do so. you ve linked reviews and brought in anecdotal evidence of you driving the cars yourself, which doesnt really add to or against what they are originally saying??? you just wanna say plato s cave to sound smart with out actually addressing the original point they made? you can argue against it that fine but to be purely dismissive and say your head is in the sand buddy your head is in the clouds lmao."
ferrari,,92,"unfortunately the highest porsche s are the same game. 918, turbos, and the gt3rs are all dct. so long as they keep the gt3 with manual that s good, though i would love if they offered the gt3rs. i went c8z06, but if it were possible for me to get one i would ve went gt3 in a heartbeat 10x over for the manual. i ve been a corvette guy, but i m eyeballing porsche heavily in the last few years for still keeping the stick alive. especially now that gm has heavily encrypted the new widebody c8s to make tuning impossible, half the fun of corvettes was cheap modifications for big power and that s no longer a thing."
tesla,,11,"the example of turning on blinkers mid roundabout is a bit dumb sorry, in your country do you not have to indicate left every time you leave a roundabout mid turn? i have like 35 roundabouts in my commute."
porsche,,28,a manual is unusable with high horsepower i never read it
bentley,,6,it looks fantastic. not what i was expecting inside or out when you said 2012. i love the w12 splash screen on the instrument cluster. x200b
porsche,,4,corvettes look better and better every day huh
bentley,,4,i noticed in your vids your cars have ma plates though and not ca. why ma? we have all the same rules as ca and probably the same expenses.
rollsroyce,,3,"big wheels ,thinner seats, less sound dampening. my 99 tahoe is far more comfortable of a ride than my wife s 17 escalade"
bentley,,59,"i don t completely disagree, but there s no reason this won t be a great gt. gt cars are traditionally two seaters or 2 2 and front engine, but the important pieces are comfort, long distance travel, and performance. this car is not rear engine, its mid engine and aston s revival of the vanquish will also be mid engine see the vanquish vision debuted in geneva . both cars will be quieter, heavier, slower, more comfortable, and more usable than their sports car brothers, and they ll both compete in the gt space."
ferrari,,4,"weird of advice if you aren t an engineer, bank as much of that shit as you can, because oil booms go fast, and health for roughnecks goes even faster. i ve seen too many people i knew make a shit ton of money last time around, spend all of it on nothing, and then end up with nothing but a load of debt and problems when the boom ended our they got injured. put a good but away, and be ready to train for and transition into something else at a moment s notice."
rollsroyce,,18,"good review. as a model 3 owner, i ve had a couple of notably different experiences to yours mainly that i ve had no issues to date with the supercharger network, as i live somewhere where evs are only now starting to really sell in volume, and i ve had no build quality issues whatsoever. before everyone in this sub starts my model 3 came from the shanghai gigafactory not fremont, and they appear to know how to build a car properly there . i agree with you about the mirrors for me too this is the only car i ve had where the range of adjustment simply isn t enough to cover what i d ideally like to see. the blind spot cameras on screen are ok but i d also prefer an indicator in the mirror itself."
tesla,,11,"i found it made way more sense to lease than to buy this time around after i crunched the numbers. it used to be and sometimes still is that buying used was the best bang for your buck, but with the used car shortage in the us, leasing has gotten crazy good. 330 mo 0 down sign and drive with first month free and free maintenance alloy protection for a 35k car makes way more sense than buying a 25k car with 2k down payment that might die on me in 5 6 years since cars are turning into cellphones lol. i have friends who bought certified used around 2011 2013, and it s like every other month they re needing to do something else that costs 500. still is way cheaper than a monthly payment but damn, i don t wanna spend that much time worrying about my car working lol."
ferrari,,15,does the w11 on this list not also bother you?
bentley,,5,your interpretation is so wildly different i m struggling here. let me try. do you agree with the following spending 300k on a depreciating asset and 300k on an appreciating asset are the same thing.
ferrari,,51,all great cars have a red start button on the steering wheel!
bentley,,19,i am a little bit biased because i own one but i feel it s a jack of all trades and master of none kind of car. it does everything decently well but not the best. i really wish the car came in manual and there was some better support for aftermarket. i feel like this car would be a monster with a turbo on it. there s a supercharger kit for it but that s not quite the same. it makes me sad so many people hate a car i love but different strokes for different folks i guess.
ferrari,,8,"my landlord did that he s got a 612 scag, a ghost, a 570s, an i8 roadster, and an mc stradale convertible and he had ordered one of the first 100 c8s produced. he intended to basically park it to be an unmolested early car as an investment vehicle sorry for the pun , then when it arrived it had shipping damage and production had already stopped so he couldn t have the car as he wanted, nor a replacement and he just flipped it for a nice profit, instead. edit oh, just curious, how s the steering wheel? mine s flat bottom, but, chevy went and pushed a boundary with the rounded rectangle . just wonder how it works for you. can you offer any impressions on it?"

tesla,Model S,6,i just chuckle at the suckers that have to deal with that dumpster fire of an infotainment system if they didn t upgrade the hardware for 25. had the most up to date version in my 23 outback wilderness and it was one of two reasons i dumped it after 8 9 months of ownership. absolutely maddening to operate while driving. that is if it s not lagging out on you or freezing up for 5 minutes because it lost connection to your phone. easily the worst system i ve ever had in a modern vehicle.

rollsroyce,Rolls Royce,9,"i m in australia and they are rare but you can certainly find owners enthusiasts around the place, guess its more of a commonwealth thing? the uk rrec rolls royce enthusiast club publishes a quarterly magazine which can be a great source of info. regarding the maintenance cost its an annoying answer but it really depends. i have friends with rr s from this 70 s 90 s time frame and the maintenance cost can be just as affordable, if not more so than the same era of german cars, there are some caveats to this though. in no particular order the overall maintenance standard for collector cars tends to be much, much higher. i know there are bmw and mercedes collectors who can be incredibly anal about the condition of their cars, but this is much more common within classic rr and bentley ownership circles. if you want to keep the engine bay sparkling and free from a single blemish of dripped oil and the leather interior as soft as it was brand new that s all doable but its either a very time consuming or b very expensive. if you re okay to treat it more like an average car and keep up to date with the maintenance servicing, the time cost requirement goes way down but so does resale value . the 90 s cars like the one you tested are danger zone because of the modern tech the typical owner base. its why i would buy an 80 s silver spur over the model you drove, physically almost the same with the trade off being its carburetted so more routine maintenance , but you don t have to stress about the abs module dying... which are now practically unreplaceable if you don t happen to know the right people. which brings me to my next point. the enthusiast owner demographic is very different this has a big impact on the ownership experience. in your 70 s 80 s merc, odds are you can jump online and there will be someone on a forum who can tell you what part you need, you can go to ebay punch in the part and find that exact part right then and there. for these cars, that s almost never going to happen. when something breaks, your options are to pay a rr specialist a wheelbarrow full of money to find the issue and then several more wheelbarrows to replace the part, or you ask around enthusiasts you know in person via the phone. if that doesn t work, you probably write a letter yes, a paper letter , to your state countries rr ownership club president who will know a guru that can either help you or tell you what book you need to look in. once you ve done that, you scour that exact same network for the part. if you re lucky, someone has one. if you re unlucky, you end up putting a note in the uk rolls royce enthusiast club magazine, the spirit every quarter for as long as necessary until some 60 80 year old from bristol writes you a letter saying that if you send them a few hundred pound, they ll ship you one of the half dozen they have of that part sitting around in the garden shed. you could keep one of these on the road for a few thousand a year if you re a willing to accept a bit of wear and tear will happen over time b willing to do a lot of the work yourself c patient if you aren t willing to either own multiple cars to cannibalize, wait 3 6 months to track down a part or pay for a specialist mechanic to sit on the phone for 4 days straight pumping every connection he s got globally for a part, they aren t the car for you. nb don t buy an ex wedding hire car, the huge odometer readings often don t even reflect the actual number of k s miles they have done, the cost of getting it back to anything like its original condition will be way more than just buying a less thrashed one. only scenario where its really a good idea is if you just want a car that looks good from more than 10ft away you re going to be ripping it back to basics and putting a new engine in. in that case its not a terrible idea, but you ll get sick of explaining the background to purists. nb 2 the newer post 2000 ish cars have much, much better parts availability. this is probably due to being newer, more standardised production techniques parts sharing larger production runs. you can ever get a decent range of non oem parts now, which is a godsend or blasphemy, depending on who you ask. tl dr if its your only car don t. if its your second car buy year 2000 or newer if its your third car buy whatever you want maintenance is iron triangle cost, quality, time. pick 2."

porsche,,82,"similar story. i had a terrible salesperson recently. took my keys for a trade in, which i had expressed interest in, but when he offered me 500 for my lexus i told him i wasn t interested and to give me my keys back. he would not until i literally told him i was no longer interested in buying the car. i had told him that my father passed away when i was younger when he asked about a co signer, and from that point he referred to me as son and claimed that he could guide me like a father figure. i d never felt more disrespected in my life. fuck that guy."
tesla,,19,why is the 3 series mentioned when speaking of the c class? why is the rav4 mentioned when speaking of the sportage? you can t deduce any reason why the dominant figure in a segment is mentioned when speaking of its competitors?
bentley,,17,"i ve put nearly 100,000 miles on my five year old genesis sedan equivalent to a g80 in 2020 . it s one of the most reliable cars i ve ever owned. the fit and finish is so good it s ridiculous. there isn t a single squeak, rattle, misaligned panel, or any issue whatsoever with the car. if i had one complaint it would be that the wipers don t have a manual intermittent setting. that s literally the only complaint about the car. it s been mechanically perfect, and the interior build quality is absolutely insane. nothing is worn out at all. it still acts like a new car. and it has a hyundai nameplate on the front. i m sure it s worth about 5,000 right now for that alone, but i paid 50,000 for this car brand new and i intend to keep it a long time. that amount of money would not have bought a nicer new car in 2015. nothing else was even close."
bentley,,7,"sign of times, car makers are producing disposable cars like this that will look out of fashion in 10 years time. they re not supposed to be automobile masterpieces that you buy and maintain and keep for 20 years. they re designed so that you buy and drive for 2 years and then you sell it and buy the new one. notice how olden cars are timeless, modern cars change their look every 3 4 years and older models start lookin a bit crap compared to the new ones."

tesla,Model S,80,"same, didn t realize how miserable mark is lol."
tesla,Tesla,22,"it s important to note this is mainly because tesla is lying about the capability of the software. terms and conditions do not cancel out fraudulent marketing and that s what they re being held responsible for. it s funny in europe, france and china they were just told you can t call it that or advertise it like that, that s lying. in america it takes deaths and lawsuits. this is a prime example of regulation are written in blood."
lucid,,222,"enjoy it while it lasts because i m skeptical that it s going to last long. any time a yt channel goes high quality, they ultimately end up locking the content behind a paywall where it slowly dies out , or they just close it down altogether. yes i m aware that hagerty is an insurance company and has different revenue streams to draw upon. i m still skeptical anyways. investors have a way of ruining great things. they aren t a publicly traded company, which is good, but all investors are the same. they want unlimited, infinite growth. eventually someone is going to take a look at the money going into this and say something about it."
rollsroyce,Phantom,4,"still, even if i had 5b, i wouldn t spend more than what the car itself will be worth in 5 years on a clock which presumably can t be removed very easily and repurposed. if it s uniqueness that rich people want, that doesn t fit the definition. edit to put it another way, with that kind of wealth, i wouldn t want to spend any amount of money much less 160k on a clock in a car that was developed with cost savings in mind. 160k for an option on a truly bespoke product is what i expect someone with that kind of money would spend on. afaik there aren t really any truly bespoke luxury cars anymore, now that everyone is owned by someone else. at least the phantom and cullinan have their own platforms."
ferrari,,23,"there are the few rare dealers in eastern washington that said they don t do adm, but they are so small volume that they likely won t get more than 4 a year and they have 20 people on a list already. so you could get in line now and have it in 2026.... more manufacturers need to adapt what ford did with the mach e. order online, pick a dealer to have it delivered to, then give that dealer the deposit. you have it in writing what the cost will be even if it s a 6 month wait. ford knows exactly how many people seriously want one and knows where to send the cars. no messing around with the dealer allocation crap. there is a central wait list for all dealers. doesn t matter if you live in l.a. or middle of nowhere wyoming. if you put in an order for a car you get it at the same time is everyone else that ordered the same spec. any extras that can be produced can be divided up in the old ways, but hot cars like this, that ll be few and far between"
tesla,Model S,2,i m interested in what the 60 0 distance time is. they already have a moose avoidance test swerve test . going fast is only good if you can also brake enough to avoid collision.
bentley,,5,"i wanted to chime in bc i m in the middle, i m more of a driving enthusiast than a car enthusiast and the urus doesn t stand out to me in traffic. if i m stock in gridlock, i ll notice it bc of the flares, but if i m just driving, they re just random cars in traffic to me. something like a gladiator or especially the cybertruck stand out way more in traffic to me bc they re not generic suv truck shaped."
tesla,,34,"this drives me nuts about toyota lexus. particularly when they ve got something that is very cool with a theoretical good set of options but... they ll just never, ever combine it in the way you want. especially on products like the lc500 and gx which are relatively low volume and not inexpensive. there s something that can really suck the excitement out of a purchase too. having to settle for a collection of options that just isn t what you wanted on something you re dropping 85k on is... maddening."

bentley,Bentley,16,"they had an e60 m5 just last week! it was a blue automatic at the king of prussia store in the philly area. carmax only stocks cars that are 10 years old or less, so most of the stuff you mentioned is at right around that age limit so yeah, it s very rare they stock it. but back when those cars were more recent, they had a bunch of them. it was not uncommon four years ago to check carmax inventory and see four or five e60 m5s. right now they have four f10 m5s, so time marches on. no bentley, though they won t carry any exotic brand, or mercedes g class, which is my ultimate sadness."

tesla,Model S,562,do 5 60mph to expose over reliance on launch control.
tesla,,3,"they ve extremely laws to make their local people buying evs which laws america and europe don t have. iirc, buying combustion engine cars in china becomes more strict. you ve to win the lottery to purchase the combustion car now. there is not thing western automakers able to ask their local partner to ask chinese govt stopping it because chinese govt really wants to win ev competition and attach china dream ."

rollsroyce,,19,"so i am from europe, but i guess the reasons are kind of the same in the past, the forums were the only place to share your cool builds, ask question, search for meetups and so on. no the people who are only into pictures, are on instagram facebook the meetups are organized on facebook the regional things are done in regional facebook groups x200b x200b x200b and the problem is, that once a forum goes under a certain threshhold of activity it sooner or later dwindles away, because it has no longer any appeal to new people. x200b people who go onto the site, see that there isn t much going on, so they don t even create an account often. in the past, all these things happened in the forums and they enrichened each other , because people knew people that knew people and they got them into the forum, or the one guy had money, the other guy had knowledge, so you had the posts from the rich guy who buys the 10k shocks and has no clue about them, asks questions and then the more technically adapt people came to the rescue with answers,."

ferrari,,7,"that would be an assured death sentence for these models. manual is very rare in this segment and has been for years. they are expecting only 25 of their total sales of these models to be manual, despite being the only manual luxury performance sedans on the market outside of the m3. they are already taking a big enough risk by going rwd only with the ct5 v bw when most of the competition m5, e63, rs7, etc went with awd."
lucid,,5,"it s the ultimate version in terms of performance, but the new e class is great because of it s baby s class like qualities. plush ride, quiet comfortable. making it stiffer, louder, and boosting performance doesn t make it the ultimate model for those things, it just makes it a different car. equally i d imagine the s580 is the better s class model compared to the stiffer s63. maybach is the ultimate model there because it builds on what makes the s class good. when a car is good because of its luxury aspects quiet and comfortable ride making it performance oriented with an amg model will always be a downgrade to what makes it great in the first place."
porsche,,7,5 hours later and there is tens of comments now here lol.
bentley,,46,"it s all to craft the image of luxury. most buyers of those cars will never use that feature. vast majority of rolls royce buyers drive it themselves, and for the one s that have a full time chauffeur, most of them aren t sipping champagne like in the movies because it s bit of a silly thing to do in a car. from my observation, those ultra rich guys that are getting chauffeured just want to power nap or manage emails between meetings. but people think of the car differently knowing that it is possible to store and drink cold champagne in the back seat."
bentley,,17,"agreed, but a lot of that comes down to expectations as well. for someone used to driving a camry the maintenance and repair costs for the m5 would be absolutely absurd. parts cost can easily be 5 10x as much as a similar item on a camry. but when you look at the fact that it s a 100k car with a v10 and a sequential manual gearbox as well as low volume of vehicles built, about 20k e60 m5s worldwide the costs seem much more in line. it does suck that a lot of the big potential repairs for the m5 are things that most people can t do at home. i have done my own throttle idle actuators at home but i m not going to do the clutch or vanos solonoids myself. even if i am capable of doing it i wouldn t want to risk fucking something up."

lucid,,79,"that s not what this is describing. this is simply the money that was taken by these brands instead of dealers. if dealers had made those transactions instead, the money wouldn t have changed...only who pocketed that money. the study says nothing about whether the customer saved anything or not. in fact, the article alluding to tesla s per unit profit being much more than the average dealer profit might indicate that customers paid more than they would with the dealership model. but that s hard to actually determine because tesla s profit might just be higher because their cost to produce is lower."
tesla,Tesla,40,it s already been said but it s foolish to blame tesla in any capacity when the driver assistance is manually overridden by the driver. and i say this as one of the biggest doubters of fsd who wants autonomous vehicles held to the highest standards.
bentley,,16,"this is pretty spot on. the truth is you cannot bend physics and speaker locations in a car are pretty bad, even in the best cases when the car has been engineered with speaker placement and vibrations in mind. to compensate for this, you pretty much need software compensation that s specifically tailored to the car in question. you could do this with an aftermarket audio system, but it d require a very significant investment and a lot of fine tuning. u savagegeese does analysis on sound systems in most of his more recent videos"
tesla,,19,lots of trailers have brakes though. it s usually single axle trailers that don t and they re small enough to not throw the tow vehicle around. proper way to get out of trailer sway it s to use trailer brakes and not the vehicle brakes. accelerating out of trailer sway makes a bad situation worse because very few vehicles have enough power to accelerate fast enough to even do that. better yet though. load the trailer properly and you ll never get trailer sway. but we d be naive to assume everyone is capable of that.
tesla,Tesla,28,
porsche,,4,"this. as cars get older, the repairs just start to cascade. one year, you might be paying negligible amounts and the next it seems like everything breaks at once. if you love the car and intend to keep it forever, it s easier to justify the repairs because it s just a drop in the bucket in your ownership time of the car. if it s just transportation, you ll never sell a car faster and, ironically, get less money out of the sale because you timed the market wrong."
porsche,,3,"im sure they got the best driver they could and did 100s of laps. their computers can also probably give them a theoretical best time. its a good time, but it also shows how a properly setup lightweight chassis with suspension and downforce can also run the same time with less than half the power gt3rs . would be interesting to see a lap overlay or side by side. rs absolutely killing it in the corners and braking, and the zr1 hauling ass on the straights. my guess is the upcoming gt2rs will destroy this time"
rollsroyce,,7,"the general public view teslas as nice vehicles. they re also mostly driving decade old shitboxes, so anything with heated seats and driving aids is bona fide luxury. my point is that public perception is very different from that of r cars and not representative of the actual value or luxury of a vehicle. hell, people think i m a big shot in my c7 and it cost me less than any model x or y on the used market currently. i also got a few comments about my new camaro in 2017. for reference, it was a 2012 my."

tesla,Tesla,9,"this is a fantastic comparison! for apple, they have proprietary screws on the bottom of their macbooks that a flathead or phillipshead won t work on. tesla has a proprietary tire that really can t be patched by any mechanic. many won t even attempt to touch them. unlike the vast majority of other car companies that can be brought to any mechanic. tesla beat just about every other manufacturer when it came to releasing an electric car. at least a cool one. the roadster and model s were in a completely different segment than the chevy volt or nissan leaf. however, the heavy hitters are catching up. mercedes, audi, ford, to name a few. tesla s share of the market will be shrinking soon. if the other companies really want to swipe market share, they gotta stand by their products. provide a solid warranty and support after it runs out. tesla s novelty only goes so far, and they ll either have to step up their support or risk losing market share to massive competitors"
porsche,,5,yeah i just talked to my mom and turns out she saw the car the night before and that was the same night she saw the seller with the check and everything. she went home after because the guy wanted to talk to the montana guy. he told him my mom was offering the full amount and asked if the guy was going to pay the full amount and get the car. if not he d sell it to my mom. the montana guy refused to pay the extra 1k and so the car went to my mom instead. the guy did order his plane ticket prior to my mom coming out though.

lucid,,62,"i guess a controversial take i have is that i can t stand hearing people whine and complain about how expensive cars have gotten. most of the time when you adjust new car pricing to an older model, it s usually around the same price if not a tiny bit more expensive than the older model, and usually the new model has improved in every single metric. as an example the 2023 corolla sedan has a msrp of 21,700, now choosing a random year like 2003 adjusting that price for inflation makes it 13,129. a 2003 corolla had an original msrp of 14,055. you compare the safety, power, efficiency, build quality, and all the stuff you get in cars nowadays versus back then and you realize that cars haven t gotten more expensive if anything, wages haven t kept up with inflation. imagine buying a car that had the lack of features that a base model 2003 corolla has for 23,231 today. it s frustrating people don t make more money, but it just hits a nerve when people complain about how pricey cars are now and how they wish they were cheap like they used to be, when objectively it s basically stayed the same. edit i already mentioned that wages have fallen behind inflation, however i still don t think it s that relevant to the point since the point is cars have not gotten more expensive relative to their older counterparts."

bentley,,8,"sure but passing even an ordinary resolution is almost impossible if a shareholder who owns 20 or more opposes it. if a shareholder or group acting in concert has 47 , it is quite literally not possible to force a special resolution, which in most jurisdictions would be required to complete this in the majority of scenarios. so under the american canadian system that leaves formal takeover bids and the purchaser would need almost 100 take up among offerees. in a publicly traded company you will never get 100 take up. so whether anyone acquires bmw will depend upon whether the 47 shareholder supports the bid. board can t merge them without the support of that shareholder either, as a general rule. the one caveat and it is a very large caveat is that bmw is a german corporation and german m a law might be way different, idk. most european states are at least sort of similar though."
tesla,Tesla,1362,"obviously, the morons who literally vacated the drivers seat for this stunt have the lions share of the blame. but from a safety point of view, tesla has done the absolute barest minimum job of detecting driver engagement. everyone else has adopted cameras for this task, while tesla continues to rely on torque sensing that is easily duped. its either incompetence, or its willful to facilitate owners to circumvent the controls. i dont particularly care if tesla owners kill themselves, but these are public roads, and such unsafe vehicles should not be permitted to travel on the same streets as the rest of us."

porsche,Porsche,11,"porsche has been positioning its model line, with the exception of the 911, cayenne, and panamera aimed squarely at china for a while now. china for several years, was porsches single largest market and a major motivator towards their shift towards evs. the head of porsche sports car development has explicitly said that without china, the entire cayman boxster line would have been discontinued after the 981. it was the primary reason the 718 switched to 2 2.5l 4 cylinders as china has aggressive displacement taxes. the ev718 was a decision made for the chinese market. so, over the years, porsche has been positioning their models to best compete in the chinese market, spending huge amounts of cash to do so and with the insane, meteoric rise of the chinese domestic ev industry, porsche is left with half a portfolio of vehicles that aren t competitive in their target market, and aren t aligned with the demands from their traditional markets na eu combined with those markets general ev adoption slow down. porsche is considering pulling out of the chinese ev market entirely, after placing a ton of huge bets on their success there. it s why they ve 180d on the macan ev only strategy."

ferrari,Ferrari,38,"the problem with doing work like that yourself on a ferrari or any exotic is when it comes time to sell it, most not all, but most buyers want meticulous service records from reputable dealers and not some shade tree mechanic doing engine out services at home with their harbor freight tools. you can really be driving the value down in the collectors market by not having it dealer serviced when you want or need it out of your life."
tesla,,11,"haha, back in the day my friends and i broke down while on a road trip in a 66 impala. pistons seized up, engine was toast, we had to figure out how to get the car home. stranded in a little shithole for a weekend, met a crazy little hippy that offers to tow us. the dude pulls up to our hotel in an early 90 s isuzu about half the size of the impala. fuck it, we need to get home amd the guy offered. pretty flat most of the way so no big deal. about 10 minutes before home we hit a steep hill. everyones watching the speedometer. 55.....50.....45 by the time it hits 40 we re all screaming give it gas!!! while the hippy guy is screaming back the pedal is down bro!!!! we bottomed out at 25 just crawling in the right lane, hazards on. good times"
rollsroyce,,12,"it s not the excitement, it s the sarcasm. making the same joke about the acceleration of a compact suv in every video loses its punch after a few iterations. there are strong who wants this? vibes, and the consumer advice ends up sounding insincere. the track tests are great you can see the passion for driving in its element there, and you get great advice about what it will take to track the car and what you ll get out of the experience. with the economy cars you get pretty bland advice a lot of the time that amounts to, if you re broke and you want a car, this is one car. it s just a misalignment of interests in the reviewer and the car. i ve read in the past that mark considers the consumer car reviews the important ones because they might actually be useful to someone, but i don t feel that in the videos. he also might never have said that, i read it here."
tesla,,3,"yeah, some things just require getting used to, and if they works well after that period i don t see any issue. i have reanult megane that was widely criticized for unnatural feeling due to 4 wheels steering. and it really did feel weird, but only for like fist few days. after that, you re used to this behaviour and it just becomes very nimble and agile car, nothing weird or unnatural about how it behaves."

lucid,,4,"if you want a new mid engined no hybrid v12 your options a very limited. additionally, many car makers outsource the making of certain parts. for example, the entire ford gt isn t even made by ford. the pagani carbon fiber looks perfect in person, so just because it s outsourced doesn t mean it s bad. according to reviews they re some of the best handling calls as well the bc for example . i do agree the interior is gaudy and some of the exterior bits are a bit overstyled. are they overpriced and is there a ton of marketing hype? probably, but what supercar isn t?"
porsche,911,152,"it s not an actual trackday to be fair it s basically an open day where the track is treated like an open road with two virtual lanes with the lane marker missing . yes, the m2 was all over the place, but that car has uk plates on so the driver is presumably on the right hand side of the car. assuming general public road rules, it could be argued that the gt3 was way too impatient and divebombed before he knew he could clear the m2 safely. that said, the m2 driver does seem to be completely unaware of their surroundings the 911 had its nose just ahead at the point of contact so should have been easily visible from the m2 given they were side by side and the 911 was not in the m2 s blind spot , not to mention a 911 gt3 at full noise isn t exactly quiet. thankfully from what other people have written in the other reddit thread you ve linked to, both drivers appear to be fine."
rollsroyce,,3,in the us we don t use the term car poor . we usually say private or e1.
tesla,Model S,5,"i think they have made it over the hump from being a novelty to a real major car company. with the big automakers converting to the tesla charging stations and ford announcing they are taking a bath on their evs right now, musk has made some very smart moves. he had his vehicles at a higher price point than they needed to be and then when the big 3 started turning out vehicles at the same target price, he was able to cut prices back down without much effect on his bottom line leaving them in the dust. love him or hate him, as long as musk is steering the ship, they ll be just fine."
ferrari,,23,"the 296 also costs 50 more than the artura, so it should have something to show haha."
ferrari,,3,"so your entire argument boils down to i don t think i ll ever be able to afford it, therefore it s totally ok to be an asshole about those that can ? because that s an utterly absurd argument that can be stretched to absurd proportions. would you think it s cool if people living in sub saharan africa called you an entitled brat surrending daddy s money because you can afford to pay 10 at five guys and buy a burger as large as your head? do you think wealthy people should be able to point and laugh at you because you aren t wealthy? oh, look at that poor. i bet if his daddy hasn t spent all their money on crack or whatever poor people do, they d be able to get a supercar one day . that s functionally equivalent to what you re doing. stop being shitty about things, and just assume that most people are moderately intelligent, relatively nice, and worked hard for and are proud of the things they ve accomplished and accumulated. you ll be a lot happier in the long run."
bentley,,5,outside of rock crawling and hardcore onroading most suv s can go off road. suv s by design were originally designed to be able to be multipurpose and do both things good rather than either one great. i don t know why people shit all over suv s just because they usually can t rock crawl. the wrangler is awesome for all levels of off road but suck as a daily on road vehicle so it s really doesn t qualify as a true suv although it improved it s on road driving over the couple of generations. still of pile of shit from a reliability standpoint. fun fact the 70 s amc eagle wagon was truly the first suv.

porsche,,23,"they aren t, i m guessing hoping that they meant the rs3, which is a valid criticism, why isn t the top end golf getting the best motor that s designed for the mqb platform? because it would cannibalize rs3 and ttrs sales. it s shitty, but it makes business sense i suppose. that being said, the ea888v3 and beyond are good motors that have a lot of aftermarket support and are pretty good out of the box, just missing that nice inline 5 sound."
ferrari,,9,fuck collector cars. they ve ruined the market
rollsroyce,,69,"surprisingly, they are pretty average in terms of reliability for a luxury sport coupe. the engine and transmission are pretty bullet proof if you get the v8s. they have a few well known issues, such as the cooling system and water pump though. it s probably about as reliable as the toyota supra bmw z4.the biggest drawback is finding a shop you can trust to work on it in the states. jags are rare so independent mechanics with jag experience are hard to find. dealership service prices are also absurd."
ferrari,,6,"toyota has peaked. they don t need to make any more new cars. this is a correct and logical opinion, i know.. believe me. but honestly, just looking at the current toyota line up, honestly how much more badass can they really get? where can they go from here?? with the update of the new gr corolla, the gr86, the supra, the upcoming celica and mr2, and the motherfuckin camry hybrid , seriously what else can they do that would make them any better than they are now??"

porsche,,7,"there s still a large difference between capable at a track day and race car though. if bmws only had the issues they do when taken to the track it becomes much more forgivable, but that s just not the case. as to why bmws are the most popular local brand of track car there, it s kind of the only real choice in a lot of ways. as fun as certain audis can be they tend to be numb and as a general rule plow pretty hard, obviously there are exceptions. the benz options while fantastic cars are often set up to be tire shredding oversteering missiles, while also being pretty isolated, again not ideal for a track. bmw puts more effort into the driving dynamics and on average is a bit lighter with more tossability feeling, desirable traits for a track day car."
tesla,Tesla,76,yes. he randomly replied to my comment on jay leno saying model s can indeed hit the numbers thread linking to his own post on why jay leno is a liar and tesla is scamming everyone. i replied back saying that expert is an idiot and doesn t account for everything. he replied back saying that expert is him and how in fact i m the idiot. i got 40 downvotes and i can t remember how many upvotes he got. his ego is r cars fault people kept egging him on because everyone here wants tesla to fail.
ferrari,,22,
ferrari,,5,"i have to add, i have a supercharged 2009 srt8 and it handles pretty well. the steering is numb but the chassis gives me feedback and i listen to the tires. i have driven camaros, porsches, and others on the same roads, and the dodge is never far behind any of them. i think unless you re a track driver, very few performance cars will have limits lower than yours as a driver, including the challenger. i am curious how a hellcat, with its extra 70 80hp and 300lbs handles compared to my car. maybe it got worse."
tesla,Model S,1,"there already exists another metric that does this way better than 0 60... the quarter mile. if you truly consider yourself an enthusiast, this is what you should be paying attention to."
bentley,Bentley,16,"i have an older bentley and even back then 1989 , when you look under the car, there s just stuff everywhere. areas that would be just a void on an american car are crammed full of various bits on a bentley. for example, most cars that have separate sub frames may or may not have a connector between them. usually just a bar with some bushings. the bentley has a hydraulic system that manages the relationship between the two sub frames and the body itself. there are two blower motors on the firewall instead of one. two distributors, two coils, two actually three different braking systems. under the package shelf there are hydraulic accumulators and various supporting piping. i think there was even stuff inside the front fenders intercooler for the turbo and related parts . everyone says mercedes are over engineered but my father worked for mercedes for 50 years and upon seeing under the hood of my bentley he said yeah...mercedes has some of the same parts...but this has two of everything. this explains the crazy weight. i think mine is like 6300 pounds? maybe the vw based ones are different but from what i hear about their engineering, i don t think so. stuff everywhere."
lucid,,15,"yeah and aston martin claim to have an ev ready but aren t releasing it because there s no demand yet. they re probably right, but i m really curious what it is, what the specs are, if it s essentially a sapphire coup in a savile row suit wouldn t be a bad thing ."

tesla,,6,"super cool data and post! i d be curious about some kind of metric for color options to sales figures. or maybe more... what high volume , and let s say that s defined by 100k sales or more per year in the us market, vehicles has the most color options. its super cool that lr and mercedes offer a dizzying number of options on things like the g class and rr but i particularly think its cool that say ford and jeep both i believe offer 11 color options some trim dependent for the bronco and wrangler, respectively. i d be curious if there s anything else selling north of 100k units a year that can match or beat those two."
ferrari,,3,"my favorite car i might ever own. to me it s the perfect size nice and small compared to the 997 and especially the 991. mine is an mk1 so the only driver nanny it has is abs. was also the last to have a throttle cable instead of e gas. everything i thought needed improvement from factory was somewhat easily rectified shortened gear ratios, lwfw, cup lsd. people s main gripes with the 996 are the interior and headlights, but i quite like the simplistic interior design and honestly feel that the headlight shape has aged well. threw on some e88s and a rs base wing and it s perfect. do i want a 997 gt3? yes. would i sell my 996 to get one? no. since i split my time between tokyo and the states, it s unfortunately back in california collecting dust with my m3 not really, just in the care of my dad ."

bentley,Bentley,7,"i disagree. you can drive around town and to the shops on electricity, no emissions, charge at home for cheap, then you can open up the engine on a backroad. of course a hybrid accomplishes much of the same, but anecdotally my nsx gets about 5 10mi on ev only at most. 50 is a massive bump up from that. the main issue is it s hard to explain to most how they function, statistically a lot of people just use their phevs as standard hybrids, but if you are informed they are great fun to live with. the issue is in cost complexity reliabilty, but you aren t buying a 296 or bentley as a value proposition. worst case you can never charge it and just use it as a standard hybrid, it s only 100 pounds or so over the previous w12 and i imagine it drives better. i am not the biggest fan of phev as a daily, but if you know what you re getting into they are a perfect fit for these pricier gt cars."

tesla,Model S,6,the big advantage of evs is their total system efficiency. most evs can convert more than 80 of the energy from the wall into kinetic energy at the wheels. tesla is known for one of the best ev powertrains in terms of system efficiency. also electricity is available in most places already including your home. unless people want all the expensive pressurizing and chilling machines in their home it s hard to beat the convenience of home charging.

bentley,Bentley,4,"slightly off topic but just because automatic transmissions are faster, doesn t necessarily make them better. that s just one metric. i can t speak for everyone, but personally, the feeling of driving a good 6mt car is a much more enjoyable feeling than driving an automatic transmission. like, exponentially more fulfilling to me. the real reason why exotic cars and even production sports cars don t have manuals anymore is because they have to be faster each model generation or they risk losing sales. even the fastest 6mt cars top out 0 60 in about 4 seconds because they are limited by mechanics. a 2009 6mt nissan 370z gets pretty much the same 0 60 time 4.5 seconds as a 2020 ford gt350 4.2 seconds , which is the most powerful 6mt ford makes. the technology of a 6mt is pretty much maxed out. now personally, as a car enthusiast, i don t mind at all. however, when you are selling luxury cars and sports cars, each new model has to be faster or have better specs or they risk losing sales. these cars are marketed to people who want the latest and greatest, which sometimes doesn t overlap with the venn diagram of hardcore car enthusiasts. i think the reason why the new c8 corvette only comes with an automatic transmission is because it would technically be slower than the c7 with a 6mt, and obviously that would be sales suicide. that s great if you are competing on acceleration specs alone, but soon when most sporty evs get sub 2 or 3 second 0 60 times, it s just a race of diminishing returns. what makes a corvette great to me is the sum of the overall driving experience, which i think will suffer if gm chases competing with electric porsche s and tesla s. in a car like a bentley or mercedes or most bmws it will be better because it suits the demographic of their target market but whether it s actually better would be subjective. anyway, that s just my two cents. a lot of what drives automotive changes is what will make the most money, not necessarily what features are better for the car community."

lucid,,14,"i had a spin in the air recently, and if the suv drives anything as well as the normal car does... because it s by far the best driving ev out there. the electric steering is almost as good as porsche. the chassis balance is amazing and it s ability to blend stability with comfort is great. and it s built properly and smartly. it felt good to be hustled, and even though the throttle was a bit too sharp, it drove unbelievably well for what it was enormous 8 billion pound luxury sedan . and i think they didn t butcher the styling for the suv conversion either. there s still a lot of form follows function , but, it s not too bad. i get the impression that they re producing an engineering first product like mercedes in the 80 s did, and toyota in the 90 s did. i hope that s enough for them to survive. it worked for those companies because they re still riding on those coat tails today. this being said... it s still an ultra luxury product. prices really aren t below 100k so it s unobtanium for the vast majority of people. they have the suv, and they probably have a few people in the model 3 affordable car research phase at the moment which is what will allow them to actually survive as a company. and final thought i don t like the new wheel dash layout. i disagree with th that the old screen was obscured. the screen was intentionally blank in those areas which were cutoff. i never found myself looking to try and find info. it wasn t broken. and now they ve got the squircle, which i m not a huge fan of. xpost from the other thread since this thread looks like it will be the one"

tesla,Model S,10,"yeah, it s barely possible to merge safely in a stock plaid. needs at least another 1000hp."
lucid,,8,"the only caveat i have to this is if they are highway patrol, electric range will be a limiting factor if a traffic stop turns into a pursuit. ev s will be much more sensitive to high speed chases as energy use scales with the square of the speed. 120 miles of range at 65mph turns into 30 at 130mph. it will most likely be dept policy to keep the battery above some level, probably 40 or 50 . so they will have to do a lot more work to keep the ev s topped up during a shift than they do the current gas cars. this will most likely limit the ev s to only working within cities, and not halfway to bakersfield on the 5. which is fine. use the right tool for the job."

lucid,Lucid,12,the air and gravity have 2 completely different methods of boosting voltage from lower voltage chargers like tesla s superchargers. the air uses something lucid calls the wunderbox and this is limited to 50kw. the gravity uses its rear motor inverter and is limited to 225kw. so charging speed on superchargers is pretty good with a gravity. the air not so much. if you re curious you can listen to lucid talk about the systems in this video

lucid,,23,"unfortunately, edmunds does theirs in whatever the weather happens to be on test day. so it s still not really apples to apples. edmunds also holds their test loops very close to test, so it s hard to know how realistic it really is. frankly, i d rather just have manufacturers publish and the epa audit range at constant 75 mph at 100 f range at constant 75 mph at 70 f. range at constant 75 mph at 0 f for trucks range at constant 65 mph at 70 f w 4000 lbs of trailer. if an ev has 250 miles of range, the in town range really doesn t matter. you can t use that much range in stop and go driving in one day, and you can charge while you sleep."

tesla,Model S,13,i was trying to be diplomatic about the range numbers. but yes expectation is 220 240 miles for the epa range of the various trims. the model s without performance already has 370 miles of range with the latest updates. an updated pack to say 120 kwhs would push that to 430 miles of range for the base and 400 or so for the performance in current dual motor form . other then the roadster there doesn t seem anyone that could touch that kind of range in the near term.
rollsroyce,,4,"since most things can be stolen with enough time and resources, use a layered security approach. a good obd lock like in our video can help stop key cloning to blank keys or i some cases starting vehicles by plugging in a hacking tool into the obd port. a good steering wheel lock though defeatable can add more difficulty and time for the theft. some info on steering wheel locks here a good car alarm a good dashcam with park mode, battery pack and cloud access. you would be able to watch your camera from anywhere. gps tracking or even apple s airtag to self track pick and choose what suits you."

porsche,,40,"for real. unfortunately i speak from experience. i grew up on a road that looks a lot like that, and there was a dead end t intersection at the end of it. farmer got tired of drunks going straight into his field and sunk some telephone poles into the ground there. he ended up killing an elderly couple that owned a beloved restaurant up the street, probably just driver error or wet roads. there was a protracted lawsuit, he knew the people who died, bad situation all around. ianal, but my understanding is from a legal standpoint, since op knows there is a high likelihood of drivers hitting whatever barrier is placed there, and a reasonable person can deduce that something hard like a concrete wall, boulders, etc. would make that accident worse, it is negligence and he could be sued. even if op wins the suit, he is still out a chunk of change, time, and effort, not worth it."

rollsroyce,,35,"to provide a counterpoint from a fellow car enthusiast dailied and tracked an s2000 for 10yrs, now in a c7 , i actually do find model 3 s to be special and evocative. what appeals most to me is how refreshingly different the vehicle is, and how it makes me re evaluate what a car is and should be. the interior is a fresh approach that seems to ask what else should you need other than plenty of room and comfort. the knobs, dials, and other controls are now all one touchscreen with a ui that doesn t feel like a budget afterthought. the phone app is good, and both it and the car receive regular ota updates and sometimes even new features this is a big one to me . regular maintenance is almost nonexistent. day to day, there s never a need to waste time at gas stations. during road trips, it plans the stops for you. it can drive itself, and supervising autopilot on long highway stretches is far less exhausting than regular driving. going fast doesn t mean being loud and drawing attention. with no engine noise, it s easier to utilize the sounds from the tires themselves to help you drive at the limit. i haven t had a chance to experience this myself, but folks are autocrossing these and having a blast. for me, there s a lot to be excited about there, and i always enjoy my time in a model 3 around town and on extended trips. edit typos and spelling. also wanted to mention i regularly drive a model 3, as my partner has one as her dd."

tesla,Model S,56,"0 60, 0 80, or 0 to anything is an inherently flawed metric. i have no idea why so many people continue to gauge car performance based on this test. for one, there is no standard for how people report these metrics. some auto journalists report this with a 5ft rollout, some report from a dead stop, some report with a prepped track. also, different drivetrains need different launch parameters to achieve their optimum 0 60 time. the va sti can record a sub 6 second 0 60 time, but you need to rev the sh t out of it and drop the clutch to build boost. no one is dumping the clutch like this regularly. but the main issue is that the reported 0 60 times are not actually indicative of what the real world acceleration feels like. 5 60 without dumping the clutch or launch control would be a way more accurate look at how these cars feel. this, or peak acceleration g force would be a better way to look at this imo. 0 80 is just as terrible as 0 60."
